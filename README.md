# SOCIOL 880: Data Management

This repository contains the code for generating [datamgmt.org](https://datamgmt.org/). This is an experimental mini-seminar I'm teaching this Spring. Tips, tricks, and general orienting hints for social science students working with quantitative data. The course is sort of misnamed.

Various hugo and blogdown features borrowed more or less directly from [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) and his excellent [teaching](https://statsf18.classes.andrewheiss.com/) and [class](https://econw19.classes.andrewheiss.com/) [websites](https://datavizf18.classes.andrewheiss.com/).
