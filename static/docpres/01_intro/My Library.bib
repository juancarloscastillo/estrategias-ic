  abstract = {From the start individualization theory is the investigation of the paradigm shift in social inequality. Furthermore it shows, how the transnationalization of social inequalities bursts the framework of institutional responses \textendash{} nation state (parties), trade unions, welfare state systems and the national sociologies of social classes. In this essay I shall try to conceptually elucidate the `cosmopolitan perspective' on relations of social inequality in three cases: (1) the inequality of global risk; (2) the Europe-wide dynamic of inequality; and (3) transnational inequalities, which emerge from the capacities and resources to transcend borders. Before that I take up Will Atkinson's question: `What exactly constitutes individualization and to what extent has it really displaced class?' (Atkinson 2007: Abstract)},

  issn = {01902725},
  abstract = {An adequate account of contemporary social structure must account for both the stabilities and the dynamics of social life. Because social structures are negotiated and redefined through individual action and interaction, models that facilitate connections between micro and macro levels of analysis are necessary in turn for a comprehensive account of social stability and change. Sociological social psychological theories such as social exchange and symbolic interaction address the interactive aspects of social behavior. The social cognition perspective, however, is uniquely qualified to address how social structure is represented, sustained, and transformed by the cognitive systems of human actors. Social cognitive conceptions of social structure are delineated through a selective discussion of social cognition and sociological models that implicate cognition. The relationships between cognition, agency, and structure are illustrated through analysis of four conceptual puzzles in order to reveal the analytic contribution of social cognition to understanding social structure.},

  shorttitle = {Justice {{Perception}} in {{Times}} of {{Transition}}},
  abstract = {This article explores how the German distribution system is assessed with regard to justice in the fifteen years after unification. It traces the development of perceived justice for East and West Germany and tries to explain the regional differences and the trends observed. West Germans evaluate the system as more just throughout the entire period, though the gap shrinks. Surprisingly the main changes in the level of perceived justice did not take place in the eastern but in the western part. In 2006 West Germans assess the distribution system as considerably less just as right after unification. The level of consent is astonishingly volatile. In contrast, the assessment in East Germany is quite stable. How can this be explained? Three groups of factors are tested: socio-economic status, the overall economic performance, and justice ideologies. It is shown how the development of perceived justice is largely formed by levels of unemployment and changes in the affirmation of justice ideologies. Economic performance and justice beliefs are intertwined: as the economy fares badly its attitudinal basis weakens. We conclude that even in countries with a well established social market economy the approval of this distribution system depends to a large extent on its performance.},

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung  Wie die f{\"u}r Deutschland repr{\"a}sentative Erhebung des International Social Justice Project vom August 2006 verdeutlicht, werden die beiden Aspekte Finanzierbarkeit und Generationengerechtigkeit von der {\"u}berwiegenden
Mehrheit der Bev{\"o}lkerung als zentrale Probleme der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung wahrgenommen. Dessen ungeachtet gelten
jedoch ausgerechnet solche Reformoptionen als {\"a}u{\ss}erst unpopul{\"a}r, die auf institutioneller Ebene f{\"u}r mehr Generationengerechtigkeit
sorgen sollen. Zudem werden konkrete konstitutive Elemente der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung wie die H{\"o}he der Beitragss{\"a}tze,
die H{\"o}he der Renten oder das Prinzip der Statussicherung als weitgehend fair empfunden. Als m{\"o}gliche Mechanismen, die dieser
Status-quo-Orientierung zugrunde liegen, werden Ankereffekte, Verlustaversion und Sozialisation vorgeschlagen und empirisch
mit Hilfe eines faktoriellen Surveys {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft. Wie die Ergebnisse zeigen, determinieren willk{\"u}rlich festgelegte Ist-Vorgaben
(Anker) die als gerecht empfundenen Renten unabh{\"a}ngig von den individuell bevorzugten Gerechtigkeitsstandards. Weiter kann
Verlustaversion einen Erkl{\"a}rungsbeitrag dazu leisten, warum die individuelle Sorge vor Statusverlust im Alter die Betrachtung
der generellen Austauschbeziehungen zwischen Jung und Alt {\"u}berlagert. Positive Reformeffekte werden auch deswegen kaum wahrgenommen.
Schlie{\ss}lich erweisen sich fr{\"u}here institutionelle Regelungen als langfristig pr{\"a}gend f{\"u}r individuelle Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen.
Selbst bei vergleichbaren {\"o}konomischen Interessenlagen erwarten Ostdeutsche eine egalit{\"a}rere Verteilung der Renten, w{\"a}hrend
Westdeutsche eine st{\"a}rkere Allokation nach Statuskriterien bevorzugen.},

of the core assertions of political economy approaches to welfare\textemdash{}that support for redistribution
is inversely related to income. We offer one of the first empirical tests of the role of economic
self-interest in individual preferences regarding redistribution in a multi-regional, global
analytical framework incorporating both individual level surveys as well as macro-structural,
national level data for more than 50 countries between 1984 and 2004. Our analysis shows that
income does not systematically explain support for redistribution in countries with low levels of
economic development or high levels of income inequality thereby challenging the implicit
thesis of homo economicus driven preferences so pervasive in the literature.},

While much social psychological research focuses on the consequences of legitimacy, far less pertains to its emergence. Here the authors examine the role of justice and power in establishing the legitimacy of a decision maker. The authors outline the identity-based model offered by Tyler that highlights the role of procedural justice and offer a complementary resource-based model. The authors argue that the power structure in an organization and the nature of power use by authorities affect the availability of the material and nonmaterial resources necessary for subordinates to do their jobs well, which in turn creates social obligations that allow for the germination of legitimacy. With emphasis on resources, the analysis thus reconsiders the role of distributive justice. The authors conclude by emphasizing the conditions under which identity concerns and resource concerns are relevant to the emergence of legitimacy and by speculating on how these social psychological processes may parallel arguments in this volume regarding the emergence of state legitimacy.},

the impact produced by higher education financing policies in Chile during the Pinochet (1973\textendash{}1990), the Aylwin (1990\textendash{}1994)
and the Frei (1994\textendash{}2000) administrations. To this purpose, CASEN databases and semi-structured interviews conducted with former
and current government officials as well as higher education administrators provide valuable information to measure the impact
that higher education financing policies had on different socio-economic groups. Access to post-secondary institutions is
seen in relation to two aspects: (a) enrollment rates by type of institution and sector and (b) access of students (18\textendash{}24 year-old
group) by family per capita income level. Major conclusion set up that despite increased participation across all socio-economic
groups within the post secondary system, upper and upper-middle income students gained access to higher education disproportionately
compared to lower, lower-middle, and middle income groups during the 1987\textendash{}1998 period.},

Chile has been cited as a successful case of development. Relatively fast economic growth over almost two decades has been accompanied by a significant reduction in absolute poverty. However, persistent economic growth and a mostly pro-poor structure of public expenditures have not been sufficient to reduce inequality in one of the most unequal countries in the world. We show that the key factors explaining this persistent inequality have been a low level of fiscal expenditures caused by low tax revenues that have not permitted enough public investment in human capital and knowledge generation and diffusion.},

und sozialschichtabh\dbend{}ngige \dbend{}bergangsmuster identifizieren lassen. In einem zweiten Schritt wird der Schwerpunkt auf die Wahl einer bestimmten Hochschulform gelegt. In Anlehnung an die Theorie von Boudon (1974)
wird nach sekund\dbend{}ren Effekten der Sozialschichtzugeh\dbend{}rigkeit beim Hochschul\dbend{}bergang gefragt. Folgende Fragestellungen stehen
im Mittelpunkt dieses Kapitels:

\textendash{} 
Wie hoch ist der Anteil der Studienanf\dbend{}nger unter den TOSCA-Teilnehmern?

\textendash{} 
Lassen sich beim Hochschul\dbend{}bergang Unterschiede zwischen Sch\dbend{}lerinnen und Sch\dbend{}lern der verschiedenen Gymnasialformen identifizieren?

\textendash{} 
Variiert der Hochschul\dbend{}bergang der Sch\dbend{}lerinnen und Sch\dbend{}ler in Abh\dbend{}ngigkeit von der Sozialschichtzugeh\dbend{}rigkeit?

\textendash{} 
Lassen sich sekund\dbend{}re Disparit\dbend{}ten des Hochschulzugangs feststellen?

\textendash{} 
Wie hoch ist die Passung zwischen der Hochschultypaspiration und der tats\dbend{}chlichen Hochschultypwahl?

\textendash{} 
Ist die Entscheidung f\dbend{}r einen Hochschultyp mit den langfristig angestrebten Berufen assoziiert?

\textendash{} 
Gibt es Effekte der Sozialschichtzugeh\dbend{}rigkeit und der Schulform auf die Wahl des Hochschultyps?

In Abschnitt 11.1 steht der \dbend{}bergang in das Studium im Mittelpunkt der Analysen. Dabei werden \dbend{}bergangsquoten berechnet und

This study examines this question using data from multiple cross-national surveys of the advanced industrial democracies. It tests the theory that greater inequality increases the relative power of the wealthy to shape politics in their own favor against rival arguments that focus on the effects of inequality on citizens' objective interests or the resources they have available for political engagement. The analysis demonstrates that higher levels of income inequality powerfully depress political interest, the frequency of political discussion, and participation in elections among all but the most affluent citizens, providing compelling evidence that greater economic inequality yields greater political inequality.},

Such data are becoming quite common in political science and provide numerous opportunities for theory testing and development. Unfortunately, this type of data typically generates a number of statistical problems, of which clustering is particularly important. To exploit the opportunities offered by multilevel data, and to solve the statistical problems inherent in them, special statistical techniques are required. In this article, we focus on a technique that has become popular in educational statistics and sociology-multilevel analysis. In multilevel analysis, researchers build models that capture the layered structure of multilevel data, and determine how layers interact and impact a dependent variable of interest. Our objective in this article is to introduce the logic and statistical theory behind multilevel models, to illustrate how such models can be applied fruitfully in political science, and to call attention to some of the pitfalls in multilevel analysis.},

The authors model legitimacy as a sense of obligation or willingness to obey authorities (value-based legitimacy) that then translates into actual compliance with governmental regulations and laws (behavioral legitimacy). The focus is on the factors that elicit this sense of obligation and willingness to comply in a way that supports rational-legal authority. The framework posits that legitimacy has two antecedent conditions: trustworthiness of government and procedural justice. Using African survey data, the authors model the relationship between the existence of a relatively effective, fair, and trustworthy government and beliefs that government deserves deference to its rules. The authors find considerable evidence of a link between the extent of the trustworthiness of government and procedural justice and citizens' willingness to defer to the police, courts, and tax department in a wide range of African societies.},

Davis and Davenport claim that the four-item index developed by Inglehart is invalid because respondents' first and second choices are randomly related and that it fails to predict respondents' positions on theoretically relevant social issues. We maintain that they make unwarranted assumptions about how responses to ipsative items should be related and demonstrate that the value indicators are powerful predictors. Clarke et al. argue that the trend toward postmaterialism does not result from long-term generational change but simply reflects declining inflation and rising unemployment over the past quarter-century. We show that period effects, particularly inflation, influence observed values. But after controlling for inflation, there is still a substantial shift toward postmaterialism. Moreover, rising unemployment partly offsets the effect of falling inflation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}This paper asks whether international economic integration negatively affects electoral turnout. The theoretical model builds on the premise that economic integration constrains the ability of national governments to shape outcomes. Citizens are conscious of such constraints and take them into account when considering the costs and benefits of casting a vote in national elections. The result is a lower inclination to vote under conditions of high economic integration. Consequently, aggregate turnout is lower the more internationally integrated a national economy is. Analysis of aggregate data for parliamentary elections in 23 OECD democracies over the period 1965-2006 robustly supports this hypothesis. The empirical estimates suggest economic globalization as a central cause of the general decline in turnout within established democracies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Researchers can thus fall victim to a form of the ecological fallacy called the individualistic fallacy. An important example is Ronald Inglehart's discovery of a civic culture syndrome. This syndrome is tested with data from the Eurobarometer, World Values Survey, Latinobarometer, and surveys of the general public in Central America. The associations found between variables in this syndrome and democracy present a classic example of spuriousness.

  abstract = {In modernen Gesellschaften mit einer marktwirtschaftlichen Ordnung erfolgt die Verteilung von Lebenschancen (Einkommen, wohlfahrtsstaatliche
Anrechte etc.) vornehmlich {\"u}ber den Arbeitsmarkt und die berufsm{\"a}{\ss}ige Erwerbst{\"a}tigkeit im Lebenslauf (M{\"u}ller und Mayer 1986).
Der Erwerb von Bildung und Qualifikationen ist eine essentielle Voraussetzung f{\"u}r den Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt (Blossfeld 1989;
Becker 1993; Hillmert und Mayer 2004; Solga 2005). F{\"u}r die Systemintegration, d.h. das reibungslose Funktionieren der gesellschaftlichen
Teilsysteme, sowie f{\"u}r die Sozialintegration, d.h. die Teilhabe an gesellschaftlichen Teilbereichen, spielt daher der Zugang
zu Bildung und Erwerb von Bildungszertifikaten ebenso eine bedeutsame Rolle wie der Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt und der Erwerb
von Einkommen (Lockwood 1964; Mayer 1994, 2000). Die Verteilung der G{\"u}ter und Positionen im Bildungs- und Besch{\"a}ftigungssystem
erfolgt \textendash{} so die vorherrschende gesellschaftliche Vorstellung \textendash{} im Sinne von Chancengleichheit nach dem Leistungsprinzip,
mit dem das Ausma{\ss} und die Struktur der sozialen Ungleichheit von Bildung, Status und Einkommen legitimiert werden (Hadjar
2008; Mayer 1975). Zugang zu Bildung oder Beruf und Erwerb von Bildung und Einkommen sollen demnach ausschlie{\ss}lich {\"u}ber meritokratische
Prinzipien als legitimer Mechanismus f{\"u}r die Verteilung von G{\"u}tern und des gesellschaftlichen Status erfolgen. Die an Bildung
gekn{\"u}pfte und gesellschaftlich anerkannte Verteilung von Status, Einkommen, Macht und anderen Privilegien wird demzufolge
aufgrund individueller Leistung als Indikator von im Wettbewerb erworbenen Verdiensten (,,contest mobility``) und nicht aufgrund
von vererbtem Status etwa nach adliger Herkunft (,,sponsored mobility``) oder nach anderen askriptiven Merkmalen wie Geschlecht
oder Rasse vorgenommen (vgl. Turner 1960). Eine Gesellschaft, die {\"A}mter, Ansehen und Reichtum ausschlie{\ss}lich nach Leistung
vergibt, erscheint fairer als eine auf althergebrachten Privilegien beruhende Feudalgesellschaft oder als ein Wohlfahrtsstaat,
der bestrebt ist, durch gezielte Eingriffe in die Lebensumst{\"a}nde von Menschen individuelle und kollektive Chancengleichheit
herzustellen. In einer meritokratischen Gesellschaft hingegen wird die soziale Schichtung nach sozialer Herkunft scheinbar
durch eine soziale Schichtung nach individueller Leistung ersetzt. Das Leistungsprinzip auf der Basis einer Chancengleichheit
im Bildungserwerb ist ihr entscheidendes Grundprinzip (Young 1958). Wenn sich aber in dieser Logik individuelle Leistung nicht
mehr lohnt und soziale Ungleichheit nicht mehr mit rationalen Kriterien wie Talent, Anstrengung und Leistung legitimiert werden
kann, scheinen die System- und Sozialintegration und damit auch der Zusammenhalt von Gesellschaften nicht mehr gew{\"a}hrleistet.},

  abstract = {What Jonsson (1993) has labelled the `Increased Merit Selection' (IMS) hypothesis suggests that access to education becomes increasingly determined by class origin and that class destination is increasingly dependent on educational achievement, as the influence of characteristics associated with family background become irrelevant. It is on this latter relationship that we shall focus in this contribution. The liberal theory of industrialism held that economically advanced societies would exhibit a high level of social mobility because the increasing number of professional and managerial positions would be filled on the basis of meritocratic principles. `Achieved' characteristics' would displace `ascribed' characteristics as determinants of social position and objective universalistic criteria would displace particularistic standards. (Blau and Duncan, 1967, Parsons, 1954, Treiman, 1970). In such circumstances what is to count as merit? Two main answers have been proposed. The first, which is of direct interest to us, suggests that merit should be equated with educational qualifications. The second definition, which must be addressed if are to be in a position to interpret the evidence relating to the changing impact of education, views merit as constituted by the combined impact of IQ and effort. While, as Jackson (2002) notes, there has been a tendency to treat these two definitions as functionally equivalent, with education providing a proxy measure of IQ and effort, this view has been increasingly challenged,},

In order to do so, we first introduce the multilevel model of sociological explanation and derive four perspectives of sociological justice research: the analysis of institution Error! Bookmark not defined. s and discourses on the societal level and the analysis of attitudes and behavior on the individual level. As sociological attitude research is the field with the most advanced theories and the broadest stock of empirical findings, we will focus on such and report its central theoretical developments and main empirical results. We restrict our review to what is usually called ``distributive justice'' i.e., justice conceptions related to the allocation and distribution of goods (primarily income and wealth) and burdens (e.g., taxes or welfare payment).},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {Endogenous growth The median-voter hypothesis has been central to an extensive literature on consequences of income redistribution. For example, it has been proposed that greater inequality is associated with lower growth, because of the greater redistribution that is sought by the median voter when income distribution is less equal. There have however been no proper tests of the median-voter hypothesis concerning redistribution, because of previous absence of data on factor-income distribution (that is, incomes before taxes and transfers) across households, and thus on the gains by poorer households from redistribution. The study reported in this paper is based on the required data, with 79 observations drawn from household budget surveys from 24 democracies. The results strongly support the conclusion that countries with greater inequality of factor income redistribute more to the poor. This is so even when we control for the share of the elderly in the population and for pension transfers. The evidence that the median-voter hypothesis adequately describes the collective-choice mechanism is however considerably weaker. Although middle-income groups gain more/or lose less through redistribution in countries where initial (factor) income distribution is more unequal, this regularity is all but lost when, by excluding pensions, we look only at explicit redistributive social transfers from which middle classes contemporaneously gain little. This leaves us searching for an alternative explanation: do middle-classes gain from transfers in the long run even if not contemporaneously?; or is the median-voter hypothesis, based on direct democracy, a proper representation of the mechanisms of collective decision making in representative democracy?},

  abstract = {The history of sociology can be thought of as the history of the reception of the classics. While this applies to all of the classical authors, it is particularly apparent in the case of Max Weber. This paper focuses on Weber's sociology of legitimate domination and the meaning Weber gives to the concept legitimacy. Endlessly nuanced, Weber's approach to domination has led to different and opposite interpretations. While uncertainty as to what Weber really meant might lead to abandon the possibility of benefiting from his work, this paper understands that further efforts are worth pursuing for two reasons. First, regardless of how much certainty can be attained, discussing Weber's categories allows the scholar to relate critically to basic sociological problems\textemdash{}which certainly go beyond Weber. Second, the intellectual history of sociology reveals itself in the different readings of Weber: these readings tell us about Weber as much as they tell us about the theoretical programs they stem from. This paper proceeds keeping these two parallel goals in mind. In order to do so it examines, first, the typology of domination in the three forms Weber presented it; and secondly, it discusses some of the subsequent interpretations, focusing on a particular stage in the history of the discipline\textemdash{}the critique of functionalism.},

  abstract = {The authors show that economic development increases the probability that a country will undergo a transition to democracy. These results contradict the finding of Przeworski and his associates, that development causes democracy to last but not to come into existence in the first place. By dealing adequately with problems of sample selection and model specification, the authors discover that economic growth does cause nondemocracies to democratize. They show that the effect of economic development on the probability of a transition to democracy in the hundred years between the mid-nineteenth century and World War II was substantial, indeed, even stronger than its effect on democratic stability. They also show that, in more recent decades, some countries that developed but remained dictatorships would, because of their development, be expected to democratize in as few as three years after achieving a per capita income of \$12,000 per capita.},

  title = {A {{New Unified Theory}} of {{Sociobehavioural Forces}}},
  volume = {24},
  abstract = {This article proposes a new unified theory of sociobehavioural forces. The goal of the new theory is to integrate theories describing five sociobehavioural processes--comparison (including justice and self-esteem), status, power, identity, and happiness--bringing under a single theoretical umbrella diverse mechanisms together with their effects across disparate domains and for both individuals and societies. The integration is made possible by the remarkable similarity of the internal core of the theories, a core comprised of three elements: personal quantitative characteristics, personal qualitative characteristics, and primordial sociobehavioural outcomes. The unified theory posits the operation of three sociobehavioural forces--comparison, status, and power--each associated with a distinctive mechanism, in particular, a distinctive rate of change of the outcome with respect to the quantitative characteristic. Each combination of elements--e.g. status-wealth-city--generates a distinctive identity and a distinctive magnitude of happiness. Thus, the theory enables systematic and parsimonious analysis of both individuals and societies via the distinctive configurations of elements. To illustrate the unified theory, we analyse the three-way contest between loyalty to self, subgroup, and group in a two-subgroup society, deriving many new testable predictions, for example, that the bottom subgroup will have difficulty mobilizing itself; that the ablest individuals in a society will not make good leaders as their first loyalty is to self; and that the proportions loyal to self, subgroup, and group differ sharply, depending on the sociobehavioural forces, valued goods, and subgroup size. Finally, the theory provides a foundation for making explicit connections among the most important themes and insights of contemporary social science, including inequality, oppositional culture, group boundary permeability, social inclusion and exclusion, segregation and integration, social distance and polarization, and bonding and bridging.},

The authors compare the fixedversus random-effects model specifications for APC analysis. They use data on verbal test scores from 15 cross sections of the General Social Survey (GSS), 1974 to 2000, for substantive illustrations. Strengths and weaknesses are identified for both the random- and fixed-effects formulations. However, under each of the two data conditions studied, the random-effects hierarchical APC model is the most appropriate specification. While additional analyses and comparisons of random- and fixed-effects APC models using other data sets are necessary before generalizations can be drawn, this finding is consistent with results from other methodological studies with unbalanced data designs.},

Consistent with the political cuing model, opposition party loyalty and presidential approval were related to support for privatization in the cases of the two countries with a longer history of competitive democracy (Chile and Costa Rica). Support for the belief consistency model was found in both Mexico and Chile but not in Costa Rica where privatization is more recent and has been less extensively carried out.},

  Im Vordergrund des Beitrags steht die Erweiterung der bisherigen Erkl{\"a}rungsans{\"a}tze zu Einstellungen zur sozialen Gerechtigkeit,
welche sich vornehmlich auf rationale Motive im Hinblick auf die soziale Position und normative Wertvorstellungen aus dem
kulturellen Kontext beziehen. Diese traditionellen Ans{\"a}tze werden um Einfl{\"u}sse der regionalen Arbeitslosigkeit erg{\"a}nzt. Eine
zentrale Rolle nimmt dabei zun{\"a}chst die theoretische Auseinandersetzung mit dem Einfluss des regionalen Kontextes auf Einstellungen
und Handlungen im Allgemeinen ein. Ausgehend von Boudons cognitivist model werden diese Mechanismen anschlie{\ss}end in ein umfassendes theoretisches Konzept zusammen mit den rationalen und normativen
Einflussfaktoren integriert. In einem zweiten Schritt wird das erweiterte theoretische Modell mit Hilfe von Mehrebenenmodellen
empirisch {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft. Datenbasis sind zum einen die Umfragedaten des International Social Justice Project aus 2006 und zum anderen die Informationen zu Raumordnungsregionen der Arbeitsmarktstatistik der Bundesagentur f{\"u}r Arbeit.
Die empirischen Analysen unterst{\"u}tzen weitgehend die Untersuchung von regionalen Einflussfaktoren neben individuellen Merkmalen.},

After empirically obtaining a status hierarchy based on the marriage patterns of occupational incumbents, I examine the influence of individual status position on book reading, frequency of reading, and diversity of book genre preferences. The findings indicate that position in the status hierarchy has a significant influence on book reading, and that this influence is net of educational attainment, income, and social class. Furthermore, status, but not education or economic resources, affects the preference for a more diverse book genre portfolio. In contrast, status is not an important determinant of magazine and newspaper reading, while education and income are. A historical account of these contrasting effects suggest that while newspapers and magazines have lost their elite character, diversifying in order to cater to popular taste throughout the 20th century, books remain a marker of [`]elite culture' in contemporary Chilean society.},

allgemeine Konzepte der Gerechtigkeit spezifiziert. Es wird dargelegt, dass man bei der Analyse materieller und immaterieller
Transfers zwischen den Generationen ein wohlfahrtsstaatliches und ein familiales Transfersystem unterscheiden muss. Probleme
der Generationengerechtigkeit werden dabei vor allem im wohlfahrtsstaatlichen Transfersystem verortet, was auch anhand von
Umfrageergebnissen untermauert werden kann. Im Anschluss daran werden die gerechtigkeitstheoretisch relevanten Dimensionen
der Generationengerechtigkeit herausgearbeitet und die in den aktuellen Debatten vertretenen Leitbilder der Generationengerechtigkeit
vorgestellt. Unter R{\"u}ckgriff auf Umfrageergebnisse aus den letzten 15 Jahren wird erl{\"a}utert, welche Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen
sich in der bundesdeutschen Bev{\"o}lkerung jeweils mit den unterschiedlichen Dimensionen und Leitbildern der Generationengerechtigkeit

des Zusammenhangs von Sozialschichtzugeh{\"o}rigkeit und Kompetenzerwerb im internationalen Vergleich geschaffen. Die nationale
Erweiterung (PISA-E; Baumert u.a., 2002) erm{\"o}glicht dar{\"u}ber hinaus die Analyse sozialer Disparit{\"a}ten im nationalen Vergleich. Um den Zusammenhang zwischen Sozialschichtzugeh{\"o}rigkeit
zu quantifizieren, haben Baumert und Sch{\"u}mer (2002) die Regression von den jeweiligen Kompetenzwerten auf den internationalen
Index f{\"u}r den sozio{\"o}konomischen Standard der Familie (ISEI) gesch{\"a}tzt. Diese Regressionsfunktion erlaubt bei gegebenem Sozialstatus
eine Vorhersage des erreichten Kompetenzniveaus. Zur Sch{\"a}tzung gen{\"u}gte eine lineare Regressionsgleichung. Die Regressionsgerade
wird als sozialer Gradient des jeweiligen Kompetenzbereichs bezeichnet. Die Steigung des Gradienten bildet die Ver{\"a}nderungsrate ab, mit der die jeweilige
Kompetenz einer {\"A}nderung der Sozialschicht um eine Standardabweichung folgt. Sie ist ein Indikator f{\"u}r den Anteil der Ungleichheit
im jeweiligen Leistungsbereich, der auf die soziale Herkunft zur{\"u}ckgef{\"u}hrt werden kann. Der soziale Gradient gilt mittlerweile

political system then citizens from countries that have not faced political crisis. Participation in
protest movements, experiences of corruption, institutional evaluations and trust and assessments
of the economy are the main variables explored to test if there are differences between citizens
from countries considered stable and those that have faced political unrest. Results indicate that
citizens from the former countries are more likely to engage in forms of civil disobedience, have had
more experience with corruption and are less trusting of democratic institutions.

Attending a private subsidized school is associated with increased standardized test scores, but the apparent impact is relatively small. Controlling for school choice using a supply-side instrument (school availability at community level) implies substantially larger impacts of the voucher system. The effect of parents' education on academic performance is smaller than that implied by simple OLS estimates that do not control for school choice. Finally, the results also show that family school choice is gender biased, females are sent more often to voucher schools while males are sent more often to private (non voucher) schools. In addition, the TSLS estimates show that females gain less than males from going to voucher schools.},

The effect of expansion on educational inequality in tertiary education is of particular importance, as tertiary education has become increasingly relevant for labour market prospects and life course opportunities. Our article studies the access to tertiary education of students with different social origins in light of educational expansion in Germany. First, we examine inequalities in access to four vertical alternatives of postsecondary education by means of multinomial regression with national data from four school-leaver surveys from 1983, 1990, 1994, and 1999. Second, for those students who enrol at a tertiary institution, effects of social origin on horizontal choices of fields of study are analysed. Results show that unequal opportunities to access postsecondary and tertiary institutions remain constant at a high level. Likewise, social background effects have not changed over time for the choice of field of study. Thus, students from different social backgrounds did not change their educational strategies irrespective of the ongoing expansion of secondary and tertiary education.},

  abstract = {If democracy is defined as the form of government dedicated to the realization of the values of selfdetermination, democracy bears a complex relationship to equality. Democracy requires equality of democratic agency, which is different from the forms of equality that flow from the values of distributive justice or fairness. Indeed, insofar as the forms of equality demanded by distributive justice are defined by reference to philosophic reason, rather than by reference to democratic self-determination, there is an intrinsic tension between democracy and distributive justice. This tension is reflected in the common conflict between rights and legislative competence. But insofar as violations of the equality required by distributive justice impair democratic legitimacy, democracy requires that these violations be rectified. Changing conceptions of distributive justice may thus fundamentally alter the preconditions of democratic legitimacy.},

In addition, the authors posit that trust is strongly affected by economic inequality. Using aggregated American state-level data for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the authors present a series of two-stage least squares models on the effects of inequality and trust on participation, controlling for other related factors. Findings indicate that inequality is the strongest determinant of trust and that trust has a greater effect on communal participation than on political participation.},

Despite the vast literatures on retrospective voting in political science and attribution in psychology, there exists little theory and evidence on how citizens apportion blame among public officials in the wake of government failure. We designed a survey experiment in which respondents ranked seven public officials in order of how much they should be blamed for the property damage and loss of life in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. We manipulated the information provided to respondents, with some receiving the officials' party affiliations, others receiving their job titles, and others receiving both cues. We find that party cues cause individuals to blame officials of the opposite party, but citizens make more principled judgments when provided with information about officials' responsibilities. These results have implications for our understanding of the impact of heuristics and information on retrospective evaluations of government performance.},

Psychological investigations of what factors influence which justice outcome that people desire (retributive, restorative, or both) have focused on two constructs: crime severity and shared identity. The crime severity approach contends that people can have multiple justice goals, and which justice goals people want to fulfil is dependent on the salient features of the situation (such as offence seriousness). The shared identity approach argues that people's desire for restoration or retribution is dependent on the shared identity and perceptions of value consensus between offender and victim in the judgement context. The findings related to both of these factors are reviewed, and possibilities for future research integrating these two approaches are discussed.},

Specifically, the study examines the determinants of definitions of hate crime and perceptions of seriousness, focusing on both incident-level and respondent-level variables. Using data from a multilevel factorial survey gathered from a sample of undergraduates, I find a general alignment between the political construction of hate crimes and college student perceptions of incidents of harassment and violence, although sensitivity to hate crimes varies by witness demographic and attitudinal characteristic.},

The conventional method, when applied to a data set of crime seriousness, is found to have exaggerated the consensus because, by using a more appropriate model, which assumes perfect agreement in crime severity between subgroups, the consensus is reduced unanimously. By breaking down the population by gender, age, and educational level, sociodemographic differentials in crime seriousness are set up. The disparity is then further examined in details by paired comparisons between a target crime with fourteen other crimes. The three factors are all found to be important in affecting perceived crime seriousness. This conclusion is different from that of previous studies. The scaling method is found to be responsible for the difference. As the Thurstone method used in this study is more responsive and can produce more discriminating results, it is recommended for future research in crime severity. Finally, the implications of the findings on some important issues, like the appropriateness of legal penalty and the construction of a crime index, are discussed.},

The results of interviews with members of the public suggest that the widely held view that public punitiveness develops primarily from concerns about crime and the courts and is primarily linked to public views about risk and dangerousness is incorrect. While these factors do influence public feelings, they are not the central reasons underlying public punitiveness. Instead, the source of people's concerns lies primarily in their evaluations of social conditions, including the decline in morality and discipline within the family and increases in the diversity of society. These concerns are about issues of moral cohesion-with people feeling that the quality and extent of social bonds and social consensus has deteriorated in American society.},

The first is the danger of crime and its salience and the second is economic insecurity. Both have been seen as sources of growing perceptions that the State is failing in its responsibility to provide for citizen's physical safety and economic security. Punitiveness toward criminals is hypothesized by some to be a way to act decisively in a time of relative uncertainty. It also serves to distinguish between the 'undeserving poor' and those who are economically insecure. Interviews with 2250 randomly selected Florida residents provide the data for this study. Our results indicate that crime salience, especially fear and concern about crime consistently predict punitiveness. When economic insecurity is measured in terms of expected circumstances in the near future, it is significantly linked to punitive attitudes among white males, particularly those who are less well educated and earn less income. The results are consistent with some aspects of an 'angry white male' phenomenon, particularly to the extent that those negative sentiments have a racial focus.},

Research from the past decade both reinforces and challenges this assessment. The public clearly accepts, if not prefers, a range of punitive policies (e. g., capital punishment, three-strikes-and-you're-out laws, imprisonment). But support for get-tough policies is "mushy." Thus citizens may be willing to substitute a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for the death penalty. Especially when nonviolent offenders are involved, there is substantial support for intermediate sanctions and for restorative justice. Despite three decades of criticism, rehabilitation-particularly for the young-remains an integral part of Americans' correctional philosophy. There is also widespread support for early intervention programs. In the end, the public shows a tendency to be punitive and progressive, wishing the correctional system to achieve the diverse missions of doing justice, protecting public safety, and reforming the wayward.},

Respondents largely agree on the relative ordering of crimes. Very few descriptive characteristics of the crimes account for much of the variation from crime to crime in the average ratings received. The more highly educated and the younger the respondents, the more likely were their ratings to agree with average ratings computed over the entire sample. These findings indicate that norms concerning crime seriousness are widely diffused throughout subgroups of our society.},

  shorttitle = {Perceptions of {{Crime}}},
  abstract = {t forty years, the study of social perceptions of crime in general, and the seriousness of criminal offenses in particular, has been of substantial interest to policymakers, courts, and social scientists. As a matter of criminal justice policy, consensus about how severe a crime is can serve as both a legal and societal foundation for certain criminal justice policy decisions, or about the proper punishment for that crime. From a social psychological perspective, studying individual differences in the perceptions of crime can supply valuable information both for basic knowledge about the thinking of individuals who differ on, for instance, gender, race, age, education, or political ideology, and for applied knowledge that can be used in a judicial or legislative arena. Alternatively, a hierarchy of the perceived seriousness of various criminal offenses can give insight into what is valued in a particular culture. The difficulty of defining seriousness, however, has led to substantive and methodological critiques of this literature. The present study is the latest to investigate the dimensional nature of perceptions of crime seriousness or severity, through multidimensional scaling techniques (MDS). MDS is a procedure that helps researchers uncover hidden structures in existing data by graphically plotting respondents' perceptions of perceived similarities (or dissimilarities) among various stimuli. When these stimuli are located on a plot based on such perceptions, underlying dimensions that respondents may have used (consciously or not) can be inferred. In two empirical studies I identify and validate three dimensions underlying perceptions of crime seriousness: amount of harm, infringement or deprivation of autonomy, and recklessness. I discuss implications for psychology, law, and policy.},

  abstract = {The attribution-of-blame model of judgments of injustice, which is the focus of this article, depicts judgments of injustice as blaming of an actor who is seen as responsible for the violation of the entitlement of somebody else without sufficient justification. Responsibility and blame are conceptualized in the model in accordance with Heider (1958) and Shaver (1985). The article briefly describes the background and the propositions of the model and its scope. Then it reports a series of four correlational and one experimental studies which tested the validity of the model. The findings lend support to the propositions that attributions of causality and intention and perceived lack of sufficient justification contribute to the perception of injustice beyond the mere perception that somebody's entitlement or deserving has been violated. However, no support was found for the assumption that perceived control of the respective agent contributes to the perception of injustice. The concluding section discusses the main findings of the studies and points to questions which should be pursued in future research in order to establish the range of validity of the proposed model of judgments of injustice.

Two studies tested this hypothesis. In Study 1, a bogus earthquake was used to test experimentally the effects of responsibility judgments (low, high). In Study 2, we surveyed attitudes about the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Our results showed that Weiner's model was supported across studies. Responsibility judgments led to anger and sympathy, and sympathy led to helping intentions, which in turn led to helping behavior.

While belief in fair outcomes (distributive just world beliefs) was generally associated with greater positive affectivity, belief in fair processes (procedural just world beliefs) was modestly associated with decreased negative affectivity. In addition, positive and negative affectivity were predicted by interactions between procedural and distributive just world beliefs, with each accentuating the general emotional benefit provided by the other. Finally, an interactive effect of procedural just world beliefs and social class was obtained for positive affectivity, with greater positive affectivity occurring for disadvantaged (lower income) individuals who had strong procedural just world beliefs.

Using data from a survey of Louisiana residents, we find that citizens at higher levels of sophistication are less likely to find the federal government chiefly to blame, and more likely to fault actors at the state level. Moreover, less sophisticated respondents tend to focus blame disproportionately on the president, a tendency to which the more sophisticated are not as prone.},

This consensus has been widely interpreted as evidence for functionalist views of crime and society. Challenging this interpretation, this paper argues that the similar attitudes between the races on punitiveness may in fact mask underlying hostilities and conflicting interests. Analyzing data from the 1987 National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Survey, we find that the punitive attitudes of whites toward criminals are based partly on racial prejudice, while those of blacks are associated with their fear of crime. These results suggest that the consensus found in many previous studies between whites and blacks on punitiveness toward criminals may be apparent rather than real, and that their attitudes toward punitiveness reflect their disparate positions in the social and economic orders.},

Multivariate models were used to assess the relationships between demographic and ideological orientations, punishment justifications, and punitive attitudes. Finally, separate models were estimated for males and females, and African Americans and Whites to explore whether these factors operated differently across groups. The results suggested that in comparison to demographic factors, justifications were relatively strongly linked to punitive attitudes. These effects were similar across subgroups, but there was an interaction suggesting that the relationship between general deterrence and punitive attitudes varied across gender and race.

  abstract = {The German statistics of police-recorded crime show a decline in total offences over the 10 years up to 2003. In contrast to that trend, survey-based evidence shows that the German public believes or assumes, on balance, that crime has increased. Moreover, the proportion of people who are in favour of tougher sentencing has increased, and multivariate analyses show that the belief that crime is rising is the factor most strongly associated with a preference for stiffer penalties. Further analysis of survey data shows that the pattern of television viewing is associated with the belief that crime is rising. This pattern of results suggests that television broadcasts that include fictional or factual treatment of crime stimulate this biased perception of reality. The article discusses the significance of these findings for national and international developments in crime policy.},

A 10 rung self-anchoring scale was used to measure subjective social status in the Whitehall II study, a prospective cohort study of London-based civil service employees. Results indicate that subjective status is a strong predictor of ill-health, and that education, occupation and income do not explain this relationship fully for all the health measures examined. The results provide further support for the multidimensional nature of both social inequality and health. Multiple regression shows subjective status to be determined by occupational position, education, household income, satisfaction with standard of living, and feeling of financial security regarding the future. The results suggest that subjective social status reflects the cognitive averaging of standard markers of socioeconomic situation and is free of psychological biases.},

Theoretically, the issue throws light on both intergroup conflict and the nature and functions of social identity. Practically, empowerment in collective events can feed into societal change. The study of empowerment therefore tells us something about how the forces pressing for such change might succeed or fail. The present article first outlines some limitations in the conceptualization of both identity and empowerment in previous research on crowd events, before delineating the elaborated social identity model of crowds and power. We then describe recent empirical contributions to the field. These divide into two areas of research: (1) empowerment variables and (2) the dynamics of such empowerment. We finally suggest how psychological empowerment and social change are connected through crowd action. We conclude with some recommendations for practice following from the research described.},

Our basic premise is that structural characteristics of neighbor-hoods explain variations in normative orientations about law, criminal justice, and deviance that are often confounded with the demographic characteristics of individuals. Using a multilevel approach that permits the decomposition of variance within and between neighborhoods, we tested hypotheses on a recently completed study of 8,782 residents of 343 neighborhoods in Chicago. Contrary to received wisdom, we find that African Americans and Latinos are less tolerant of deviance--including violence--than whites. At the same time, neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage display elevated levels of legal cynicism, dissatisfaction with police, and tolerance of deviance unaccounted for by sociodemographic composition and crime-rate differences. Concentrated disadvantage also helps explain why African Americans are more cynical about law and dissatisfied with the police. Neighborhood context is thus important for resolving the seeming paradox that estrangement from legal norms and agencies of criminal justice, especially by blacks, is compatible with the personal condemnation of deviance.},

We identify the developmental process through which these relations develop as legal socialization, a process that unfolds during childhood and adolescence as part of a vector of developmental capital that promotes compliance
with the law and cooperation with legal actors. In this paper, we show that ties to the law and perceptions of law and legal
actors among children and adolescents change over time and age. We show that neighborhood contexts and experiences with legal
actors shape the outcomes of legal socialization. Children report lower ratings of legitimacy of the law and greater legal
cynicism when they view interactions with legal actors as unfair and harsh. We show that perceived legitimacy of law and legal
authorities shapes compliance with the law, and that these effects covary with social contexts including neighborhood. We
identify neighborhood differences in this relationship that reflect differential experiences of children with criminal justice
authorities and other social control agents. The results suggest that legal actors may play a role in socialization processes
that lead to compliance with or rejection of legal and social norms.},

  shorttitle = {Unequal but {{Fluid}}},
  abstract = {A major finding in comparative mobility research is the high similarity across countries and the lack of association between mobility and other national attributes, with one exception: higher inequality seems to be associated with lower mobility. Evidence for the mobility-inequality link is, however, inconclusive, largely because most mobility studies have been conducted in advanced countries with relatively similar levels of inequality. This article introduces Chile to the comparative project. As the 10th most unequal country in the world, Chile is an adjudicative case. If high inequality results in lower mobility, Chile should be significantly more rigid than its industrialized peers. This hypothesis is disproved by the analysis. Despite vast economic inequality, Chile is as fluid, if not more so, than the much more equal industrialized nations. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a decline in mobility as the result of the increase in inequality during the market-oriented transformation of the country in the 1970s and 1980s. Study of the specific mobility flows in Chile indicates a significant barrier to long-range downward mobility from the elite (signaling high "elite closure"), but very low barriers across nonelite classes. This particular mobility regime is explained by the pattern, not the level, of Chilean inequality-high concentration in the top income decile, but significantly less inequality across the rest of the class structure. The high Chilean mobility is, however, largely inconsequential, because it takes place among classes that share similar positions in the social hierarchy of resources and rewards. The article concludes by redefining the link between inequality and mobility.},

It begins by noting the centrality of inequality in helping and inter2013group relations. The implications of this to affirmative action programs are noted. Following this, a model of inter2013group helping relations is proposed. It suggests that when the high status group provides to the low status group dependency oriented help, it may do so in order to establish dominance. The willing receptivity of the low status group may indicate its acceptance of the inequality, and lack of receptivity for such help may be motivated by the desire to achieve social equality. Empirical findings that are relevant to this analysis are presented in studies using Israeli students as research participants.},

evidence that goes beyond presidential elections and public opinion polls. This research allows us to
determine that the socioeconomic conditions (measured through the index of human development) have
the expected effects on the percentage of votes obtained by each of the two major coalitions of the
country (the governing Concertaci{\'o}n, and the opposition Alianza). In general terms, the Concertaci{\'o}n
obtains better results in the communes with greater values of the index of human development and the
Alianza in communes with lower levels of human development. Nonetheless, if we considered the curvilinear
effects, the Alianza perform better in communes with extreme values of IDH and the Concertaci{\'o}n in the
communes with average values. In other words, the Concertaci{\'o}n presents a distribution with a shape
similar to an inversed U ({$\cap$}), and the Alianza otherwise ({$\cup$}). With respect to the vote of women we can
affirm that, although they still tend to favor parties of the Alianza, women simultaneously tend to vote more
to the women than to the men. Therefore, we can observe gender solidarity at the polls.},

  abstract = {The goal of this research was to test whether the relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation is direct or mediated by personal variables such as self-esteem, locus of control, and political efficacy, and to detect how such a mediating process might operate if it exists. Two forms of participation, namely active political participation and the more passive psychological involvement of citizens in the democratic process, were treated as separate but related facets of participation. Four competing models were advanced and tested. The data were collected from 434 citizens in the north of Israel who were interviewed by questionnaire. The analysis was performed by structural equations modeling with LISREL VIII. The findings show that the relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation can be better understood as being mediated by personal variables rather than direct. This is demonstrated by the many nonsignificant paths in the direct model. The findings also reveal that active political participation and psychological involvement are distinct but related constructs, where involvement leads to active participation. In addition, all research variables were related more strongly to psychological involvement than to active political participation. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for future research on political participation.},

However, this expansion of the political action repertoire of citizens also entails the question of equal participation opportunities. It can be argued that contemporary ideals of democratic participation assume an equal representation of citizens' interests. In this article we analyse the equality of participation patterns using comparative data from the 2004 ISSP survey. Our results suggest that non-institutionalised forms of participation increase patterns of inequality due to education but strongly reduce or even reverse gender and age inequalities. As such, both institutionalised and non-institutionalised forms of participation have specific (dis)advantages from the perspective of preserving equal access to democratic decision-making procedures.},

Three studies document the validity of the new scale of measurement. The first study (N~=~1673) examined the psychometric properties of the scale in accordance with classical test theory. This led to the identification of a unidimensional factor structure, including perceived political self-efficacy in promoting one's own political opinion, in sustaining the political programs of the party to which one belongs, and in monitoring one's own political representatives' commitment. The second study (N~=~632) further confirmed the internal and construct validity of the scale; criterion validity was also investigated using several indicators of political interest and participation. The third study (N~=~1176) showed that politicians holding offices have higher levels of perceived political self-efficacy than partisans and voters, further corroborating the criterion validity of the scale.

The resources considered are time, money, and civic skills-those communications and organizational capacities that are essential to political activity. These skills are not only acquired early in life but developed in the nonpolitical institutional settings of adult life: the workplace, organizations, and churches and synagogues. These resources are distributed differentially among groups defined by socioeconomic status. A two-stage least squares analysis shows these resources have powerful effects on overall political activity, thus explaining why socioeconomic status has traditionally been so powerful in predicting participation. We disaggregate overall activity into three kinds of acts: those that involve giving time, those that entail donating money, and voting. Each requires a different configuration of resources resulting in different patterns of stratification across various political acts.},

It finds that most studies are too narrow in the hinds of variables that they include and that explanatory power is reduced as a result. Such participation is significantly greater for certain hinds of variables: contextual (for example, smaller community), social background (for example, higher education), personality (for example, more efficacy/internal locus of control), and attitude (for example, more group attractiveness) as well as situational variables (for example, being asked to join). Very few studies combine measures of each type of variable. When several predictor realms arc included, much higher variance is accounted for. Other social participation (political, mass media, recreational, and so on) is associated with volunteer participation. This association confirms a general activity model that posits a clustering of different types of socioculturally approved discretionary activity.},

(2) Unequal turnout spells unequal political influence. (3) U.S. voter turnout is especially low, but, measured as percent of voting-age population, it is also relatively low in most other countries. (4) Turnout in midterm, regional, local, and supranational elections--less salient but by no means unimportant elections--tends to be especially poor. (5) Turnout appears to be declining everywhere. The problem of inequality can be solved by institutional mechanisms that maximize turnout. One option is the combination of voter-friendly registration rules, proportional representation, infrequent elections, weekend voting, and holding less salient elections concurrently with the most important national elections. The other option, which can maximize turnout by itself, is compulsory voting. Its advantages far outweigh the normative and practical objections to it.},

Our conceptual model of cumulative advantage/disadvantage identifies the different ways in which disadvantages can have cumulative effects on social outcomes generally and on civic participation in particular. Our framework also suggests how patterns of advantage and disadvantage may be mediated by social institutions. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Survey, we show that disadvantages rooted in the family have major impact on all groups of young citizens and that family disadvantage interacts with school disadvantage for whites. We also show that the effects of early parenthood, being arrested, and dropping out of school have differential effects depending on race. We also show that community colleges function as civic leveling institutions2014especially for African American youth.},

This paper investigates the predictive value of personality characteristics, political values, and social conditions for civic engagement. Data from the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 2000 (n = 1,587) show that active citizens have more human and social capital available to them, they are more interested in politics, have more post materialistic value orientations, prefer leftist or Christian political parties, are less conscientious persons, and show more empathic concern with other people. Relations of personality characteristics with civic engagement were partly intermediated by church attendance and the level of education and varied in complex ways with hourly wages.

Empirical data on citizen attitudes are now available on a near global scale. However, this increase in knowledge has occurred as the processes and structures of contemporary politics are transforming citizen politics. Thus, although more is known about contemporary electorates, the behavior of the public has become more complex and individualistic, which limits the ability to explain the behavior with the most common models.

  abstract = {More than two decades ago, the authors of Political Action (Barnes et al. 1979) predicted that what was then called "unconventional political participation" would become more widespread throughout advanced industrial societies, because it was part of a deep-rooted intergenerational change. Time series data from the 1974 Political Action survey, together with data from four waves of the World Values Surveys demonstrates that this change has indeed taken place--to such an extent that petitions, boycotts, and other forms of direct action are no longer unconventional but have become more or less normal actions for a large part of the citizenry of post-industrial societies. This type of elite-challenging actions also played an important part in the Third Wave of democratization--but after the transition to democracy, most of the new democracies subsequently experienced a post-honeymoon phase of disillusionment with democracy, in which direct political action declined. This paper analyzes data from more than 70 countries containing more than 80 percent of the world's population, interpreting the long-term dynamics of elite-challenging political participation in both established democracies and new democracies. Our interpretation implies that the current decline in direct political action in the new democracies is a "post-honeymoon" period effect; in the long run, we expect that elite-challenging activity will move on an upward trajectory in most of the new democracies, as has been the case in virtually all established democracies.},

The dictator game has been the standard experimental design for studying fairness preferences, but it only captures a situation where there is broad agreement that fairness requires equality. In real life, people often disagree on what is fair because they disagree on whether individual achievements, luck, and efficiency considerations of what maximizes total benefits can justify inequalities. We modified the dictator game to capture these features and studied how inequality acceptance develops in adolescence. We found that as children enter adolescence, they increasingly view inequalities reflecting differences in individual achievements, but not luck, as fair, whereas efficiency considerations mainly play a role in late adolescence.},

First, the police need public support and cooperation to be effective in their order-maintenance role, and they particularly benefit when they have the voluntary support and cooperation of most members of the public, most of the time. Second, such voluntary support and cooperation is linked to judgments about the legitimacy of the police. A central reason people cooperate with the police is that they view them as legitimate legal authorities, entitled to be obeyed. Third, a key antecedent of public judgments about the legitimacy of the police and of policing activities involves public assessments of the manner in which the police exercise their authority. Such procedural-justice judgments are central to public evaluations of the police and influence such evaluations separately from assessments of police effectiveness in fighting crime. These findings suggest the importance of enhancing public views about the legitimacy of the police and suggest process-based strategies for achieving that objective.},

For example, research identifying and explaining health disparities across demographic strata may seek to understand the health effects of patient attitudes or private behaviors. Such personal attributes are difficult or impossible to observe directly and are often best measured by self-reports. Defensible use of self-reports in quantitative comparative research requires not only that the measured constructs have the same meaning across groups, but also that group comparisons of sample estimates (eg, means and variances) reflect true group differences and are not contaminated by group-specific attributes that are unrelated to the construct of interest. Evidence for these desirable properties of measurement instruments can be established within the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) framework; a nested hierarchy of hypotheses is tested that addresses the cross-group invariance of the instrument's psychometric properties. By name, these hypotheses include configural, metric (or pattern), strong (or scalar), and strict factorial invariance. The CFA model and each of these hypotheses are described in nontechnical language. A worked example and technical appendices are included.},

Analyses were carried out using one-year follow-up data consisting of 219 Finnish employees working in four organizations. A three-step analytic procedure was used. First, a one-factor, a three-factor, and a second-order factor model were specified and compared separately in two measurements. Second, the stability of the constructs in the three alternative models were tested by longitudinal factor analysis models. Third, changes in the level of the latent factors over time were studied. The results showed that the three-factor and the second-order factor model fitted the data better than the one-factor model. Sense of coherence was also found to be a moderately stable personality factor across the one-year period. Mean changes in the latent factors (i.e., total sense of coherence and its three components) over time were not found.},

  abstract = {This research examined longitudinal measurement invariance in the satisfaction with life scale using two studies. The first followed a sample of 236 university students (93 male and 143 female) who completed the SWLS twice over a two-month interval. The second used a sample of 242 adolescent athletes (133 male and 109 female) who completed the SWLS three times over a period of six months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine longitudinal measurement invariance. For the university student sample, results showed that the SWLS is partial strict invariant (equality of factor patterns, loadings and intercepts across time for all items and equality of item uniqueness for Items 1, 2, 4 and 5 across time). For the adolescent athlete student sample, the SWLS is partial strong invariant (equality of factor patterns, loadings across time for all items and equality of intercepts for Items 2, 3, and 4 across time). For both samples, stability coefficients across time were moderately high and latent factor means were not significantly different across time. Generally, these results suggest that the SWLS has satisfactory psychometric properties for longitudinal measurement invariance.},

  abstract = {The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is the most commonly used instrument for assessing OCD in clinical trials, but little information is available regarding its appropriateness with patients of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. We examined the factor structure and measurement invariance of this widely used measure, across individuals from four racial and ethnic groups utilizing both university and outpatient samples. Results indicated that a two-factor (Obsessions and Compulsions) model fit the undergraduate and outpatient samples and was structurally invariant across racial/ethnic groups. Minimal evidence of non-invariance was observed across racial/ethnic groups, with the exception that items on the Obsessions subscale may, at lower levels, under-estimate obsessive concerns among Black individuals. Overall, the Y-BOCS appears to show invariance across people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, although caution should be taken in comparing scores obtained from Black patients to current norms given evidence of substantial non-invariance on the Obsessions scale.},

A structural equation perspective is used, showing that without an explicit measurement model relating indicators to latent variables and measurement errors, none of these conventional beliefs hold without qualifications. Moreover, a "causal" indicator model is presented that sometimes better corresponds to the relation of indicators to a construct than does the classical test theory "effect" indicator model.},

The incongruence between the implicit conceptual dimensionality on the one hand and methodological operationalization on the other makes room for discussion about whether it would be advantageous to measure the 3 facets of RWA separately. I rely on three arguments: (1) confirmatory factor analyses showing that three-dimensional scales fit the data better than the conventional one-dimensional practice; (2) the dimensions showing a considerable interdimension discrepancy in their capability to explain validation criteria; and (3) the dimensions showing an intradimensional discrepancy which is dependent upon the research question. The argumentation is illustrated by empirical evidence from several Web-based studies among German Internet users.},

(2) Among 18,587 medical inpatients, there were 34 patients admitted for BMD in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy; one of the latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride, but it is doubtful whether this drug was the cause of the BMD. (3) Among 24,795 medical, surgical, and gynecological patients surveyed over a ten-month period in 1972, there were four who were admitted for BMD; one of the latter had a reversible leukopenia attributed to trifluoperazine hydrochloride.},

Both 9-AAP and DAPN inhibit competitively the l-epinephrine-dependent adenylate cyclase activity [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] in turkey erythrocyte membranes without affecting the fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Similarly, 9-AAP and DAPN inhibit in a competitive manner the binding of [(125)I]-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol to these beta-adrenergic receptors. The two fluorescent beta-adrenergic blockers 9-AAP and DAPN probe specifically beta-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system as well as in other organs when injected into rats. The fluorescence pattern can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy performed on cryostat slices of these organs. The appearance of the characteristic fluorescence pattern can be blocked in a stereospecific fashion by a prior injection of l-propranolol and not by a prior injection of d-propranolol. These compounds therefore offer a powerful means to map beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo. The stereospecific displacement of 9-AAP from the beta-adrenergic receptors of turkey erythrocyte membranes by l-propranolol and by l-epinephrine can be detected in vitro using front-face fluorescence. The potential use of these compounds to probe beta-receptors in vitro and in vivo is discussed.},

The abdominal portion of the vagus contained gastrin in amounts ranging from 16 to 273 pmol/g of nerve tissue (wet weight). The thoracic and cervical portion of the vagi contained only minute amounts of gastrin. Gel chromatography of extracts of human, canine, and feline abdominal vagi monitored by region-specific antisera against heptadecapeptide gastrin and triacontatriapeptide cholecystokinin revealed that the vagal gastrin immunoreactivity predominantly consisted of heptadecapeptide gastrin. In addition, the vagi contained small amounts of the NH2-terminal tridecapeptide gastrin fragment as well as of the putative biosynthetic gastrin precursors, components I and II. No cholecystokinin-like molecules were demonstrable. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated gastrin-containing nerves in the intestinal wall. The nerves were found to be most numerous in the large and distal small intestine. These findings suggest that heptadecapeptide gastrin may represent a new vagal neurotransmitter.},

Se utilizaron los resultados de las encuestas del CERC desde 1986 referidos a legitimidad y eficacia de la democracia. Los an{\'a}lisis muestran a Chile entre los pa{\'i}ses de Am{\'e}rica Latina que tienen un apoyo m{\'a}s modesto a la democracia, pese a los buenos indicadores econ{\'o}micos que se dieron durante buena parte de los a{\~n}os noventa. A su vez, estos resultados se han mantenido constantes en el tiempo. An{\'a}lisis de regresi{\'o}n log{\'i}stica se{\~n}alan que el bajo apoyo a la legitimidad y a la eficacia de la democracia en Chile es predicho por una variedad de factores existentes antes de la inauguraci{\'o}n del orden pluralista. En virtud de estos resultados, se afirma que la experiencia de Chile no apoya la tesis de que la existencia de un r{\'e}gimen autoritario pasado fortalezca la legitimidad sobre la democracia, sino que constituye un punto de referencia para que los partidarios del antiguo r{\'e}gimen traten de mantener distancia con la democracia. Se muestra la importancia del contexto pol{\'i}tico chileno para comprender dichos comportamientos.}

New evidence shows that during the 1980s and 1990s the composition of world income inequality experienced a fundamental change, characterized by the diminishing significance of between-nation income differences and the growing prominence of within-nation inequalities. Two competing trends account for this change: (1) steady growth in the average level of income inequality within nations, and (2) a decline in income inequality between nations. These recent trends signify a reversal in one of the major legacies of the Industrial Revolution-the internationalization of world income inequality across national borders. The findings raise important questions for future studies of cross-national inequality and development.},

Whilst there is undoubtedly growing interest in these alternatives, they have not had the impact that many might have hoped. In this paper, I outline Paul Ricoeur's work on the social imaginary, ideology and utopia, and use this as a critical hermeneutic to understand the failure of new movements' within social psychology to move the discipline forward. The social imaginary is the ensemble of stories possessed by all societies that serve to mediate human reality. Ricoeur uses this concept to understand and conceptualize the distinction between ideology and utopia. Ideology and utopia are reconceptualized by Ricoeur as integration/identity and rupture/critique, respectively. I argue that social psychology vacillates between these two positions and, as yet, has not been able to engage dialectically with both.},

Assuming that basic income can be seen as a radical extension of the universal welfare state, we pursue this question by investigating whether popular reactions towards a basic income proposal are susceptible to persuasion that invokes attitudes towards immigration. The study is based on survey data covering a representative sample of the Norwegian electorate. We find that a comfortable majority express sympathy with the idea of a basic income, and that the structure of initial support for the basic income proposal is well in line with established findings concerning attitudes towards welfare state institutions and redistributive policies more generally. However, by applying a persuasion experiment, we show that negative attitudes towards immigration can be mobilized to significantly reduce the scope of support for a basic income proposal among the Norwegian electorate.},

Median trends were not the same for all groups--women's earnings generally increased--but the growth in earnings inequality has been experienced by all groups. Even white men employed full-time, year-round--traditionally the most privileged and secure group--could not escape wage stagnation and polarization. These patterns suggest research questions that go beyond conventional sociological interest in racial and gender wage gaps, refocusing attention on more general changes in labor market dynamics. The debates over the origins of the rise in US inequality cover a wide range of issues that can be roughly grouped into four categories: the changing demographics of the labor force, the impact of economic restructuring, the role of political context and institutions, and the dynamics of globalization. We review the empirical literature here, and challenge the field of sociology to reconstruct its research agenda on stratification and inequality.},

In such conditions, his project was to the orize the way in which economic classes became agents that would institute political order.

Specifically, the authors posit that the effect of economic inequality on cross-national homicide rates is mediated by the perceived legitimacy of the system of stratification; that is, the effect of economic inequality on cross-national homicide rates should be substantially attenuated once perceived legitimacy is controlled. The authors test this hypothesis with data from 33 of the 44 nation-states that participated in the third wave of the World Values Survey. Negative binomial regression analyses reveal that perceptions of legitimacy do not mediate the effects of economic inequality on homicide. However, they do indicate that the impact of economic, and political, illegitimacy on homicide depends on the level of modernity. The implications of these findings for the economic inequality-homicide relationship are explored.},

General characteristics of the problem of development and definitions of the term are discussed in the introductory sections. The perspectives reviewed are labeled "development as social differentiation," "development as enactment of values," and "development as liberation from dependency." The main trend noted is movement from earlier extrapolations of theories based on the unique European experience to more historically grounded analyses. Recent approaches to development are not without limitations, and these are reviewed, as are those of earlier evolutionary and psychosocial perspectives.},

To understand the foundations of Weber's class analysis one must look beyond his most synoptic treatments of class in Economy and Society and see how his concept of class is intimately linked to his investigations of the broad problem of rationalization in modern society. Class, in these terms, is the way economic power is distributed when economic action is organized to the greatest degree in an instrumentally-rational manner. The problem of exploitation-the extraction of labor effort from workers-is treated, in this framework, primarily as a problem of technical efficiency and economic rationality in creating work incentives and effective discipline. This conceptualization leads to a relatively impoverished understanding of the nature of antagonistic interests generated by class relations.},

  abstract = {The purposes of this study were twofold: (a) based on the analysis of covariance structures, to test for the equivalence of a well-known measuring instrument across two culturally diverse groups and (b) provided with findings of nonequivalent items, to identify possible determinants of their noninvariance; post hoc investigations included tests for evidence of item bias using an ANOVA-based approach and examination of graphical displays of item response and distributional patterns. Example data comprised item responses to the four nonacademic subscales of the Self Description Questionnaire I (SDQ-I) for Australian (N = 497) and Nigerian (N = 439) adolescents. Despite similarly specified and well-fitting factor structures for both cultural groups, findings revealed evidence of both measurement and structural noninvariance. Results underscore previous caveats regarding interpretation of instrument equivalence; they add also to the growing body of skepticism that queries whether measuring instruments can ever be totally equivalent when used in cross-cultural comparisons.},

It was predicted that those who believed in the just world would be less altruistic and hence sympathetic to people with disabilities and more sceptical about charitable giving. All measures had satisfactory internal reliability. As predicted just (but not unjust) world belief scores were associated with negative views of people with disability. Just and unjust world scores were positively correlated with beliefs in the inefficiency of charitable giving, and the purpose of charity. Whereas just world beliefs were positively correlated with beliefs about the efficiency of charitable giving and ideas that charitable givers are altruistic, unjust world beliefs were associated with beliefs that much charitable donating is done for cynical reasons.},

Two laboratory experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. The effect of guilt on charitable-donation intention and actual donations was mediated by a sense of responsibility. Additionally, the presence of others enhanced the sense of responsibility to behave prosocially. These findings have implications for the design of charitable-donation campaigns.

Two main themes are selected for analysis: (a) the kinds of experience that people have had of others in need, and (b) the organization of giving, formally or informally, within social institutions. These themes are used to construct a conceptual framework showing that charitable giving reflects variations in the relationship of individuals to the community of which they are a part. This is a critical alternative to explanations of charity based upon either individual motive, social norms, or the setting in which the solicitation of gifts occurs.},

The model is used to analyse the neo-liberal theory of stratification and to assess the consequences of some of the criticisms that have been made of it. In particular, the intergenerational transmission of wealth and privilege, and the existence of ethnic, gender and other forms of ascriptive disadvantage, reduce economic efficiency, although they do not always diminish the extent of social mobility. Furthermore, excessive intragenerational inequality may inhibit, rather than encourage, economic growth. We show that there is no necessary link between rates of social mobility and levels of economic growth. This, we suggest, provides an explanation of why rates of social mobility show very little cross-national variation and display no very evident trend over time towards greater societal openness.},

Some sociologists' reservations about rational choice arise from a misunderstanding of the theory. The first part of this essay therefore introduces rational choice as a general theoretical perspective, or family of theories, which explains social outcomes by constructing models of individual action and social context. Thin models of individual action are mute about actors' motivations, while thick models specify them ex ante. Other sociologists' reservations, however, stem from doubts about the empirical adequacy of rational choice explanations. To this end, the bulk of the essay reviews a sample of recent studies that provide empirical support for particular rational choice explanations in a broad spectrum of substantive areas in sociology. Particular attention is paid to studies on the family, gender, and religion, for these subareas often are considered least amenable to understanding in terms of rational choice logic.},

Using multivariate multilevel analysis, data from the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 were analyzed, encompassing 102,396 lower secondary-school students (14-year-olds) in 4,078 schools in 31 countries. The results indicate that schools have a small influence on students' civic knowledge and hardly an impact on civic attitudes and intended civic behavior. Civic competences are mainly explained by individual student characteristics and out-of-school factors. Factors at the school level that were found to make a difference in students' civic competences are related to stimulating a democratic classroom climate in which free dialogue and critical debate on controversial political and social issues are encouraged, nurturing positive interpersonal relationships and creating opportunities for students to learn and practice democracy.},

  abstract = {Much political economy work on the politics of public policy and particularly redistribution builds
on an assumption that individual income is negatively related to demand for redistribution. Since
aggregate income inequality is not positively related to aggregate redistribution cross-nationally,
various efforts seek to understand why political institutions fail to efficiently aggregate citizen
preferences. This paper approaches this puzzle from a different perspective, instead seeking to
understand the ways economic, social, and political context may shape preference formation
and condition the individual-level relationship between income and demand for government
redistribution. Using 300 country-surveys in 50 countries between 1985 and 2008 to model the
relationships among country-level characteristics, individual income and support for
redistribution, this paper finds evidence to suggest that not only do political institutions,
inequality, and existing redistribution shape the formation of preferences, but that social
diversity and dominant cultural values do as well.},

This study syn thesizes literature on organizational legitimacy, crisis management, and niche-width theory to provide an investigation of the effects of crisis-response strategies on per ceptions of organizational legitimacy. Using a quasi-experimental, 2 X 2 X 4 design, the study tests the hypotheses that (a) organizations that produce consis tent crisis responses across stakeholders will enhance their legitimacy, while organ izations that produce inconsistent crisis responses will reduce theirs; (b) generalist organizations are perceived as being more legitimate than specialist organizations; and (c) when combined, niche-width and crisis-response consistency will produce differing effects on organizational legitimacy.

Multilevel analysis was applied on the dataset of the IEA Civic Education Study (CIVED; Torney-Purta, Lehmann, Oswald, \& Schulz, 2001), which was conducted among junior secondary-school students (age 14), their schools, and their teachers. In total, 28 countries, 4,136 classrooms, and 93,565 students were included in the analysis. The results indicated that the influences on students' civic knowledge are multilevel. Students' civic knowledge and skills were partially explained by individual characteristics, by factors related to quality and opportunities for civic learning offered by classrooms and class composition, and by factors at the national context level. We conclude that most effectiveness factors are relevant for the field of civic and citizenship education and that schooling and educational policy matter for students' success in this field.},

Using various analysis techniques, the validity of this measure is assessed in a random sample of 201 University of Kentucky students. The results of the analysis are taken as evidence for the construct and discriminant validities of the measure and for assuming the truth of a central hypothesis in many theories of legitimacy.},

We investigate that conventional wisdom using an experiment embedded within a representative national sample in the United States. We test hypotheses concerning not only the effect of institutional legitimacy on acquiescence, but also the influence of partisanship, the rule of law, and simple instrumentalism on willingness to accept an objectionable policy decision. Our analyses reveal that legitimacy does matter for acquiescence, and that the Supreme Court is more effective at converting its legitimacy into acceptance than is Congress. Yet, many important puzzles emerge from the data (e.g., partisanship is not influential), so we conclude that Legitimacy Theory still requires much additional empirical inquiry.},

  abstract = {This study explores the potential cross-cultural generalizability of a conceptual framework for understanding the multifaceted universe of contents and structure of human social justice judgments (SJJ). The hypothesized framework identifies four elemental facets needed to define SJJ and specifies the types of justice contents people are likely to distinguish when evaluating the justness of a distribution--principles and distributive rules, social resources, sign of the outcome distribution (positive or negative), and the type of social context in which resources are distributed. To empirically verify the fit between the hypothesized structure, smallest space analysis was applied, and earlier findings obtained in an Israeli sample were compared to findings obtained in East and West German samples. Separate replications conducted in the East and West German samples revealed that the multidimensional configurations of SJJ intercorrelations could be partitioned into distinct regions of items that correspond to the facets' hypothesized elements and their expected arrangements},

Three variables (which measure good governance, democratic rights, and welfare gains) are then chosen from among all strongly correlated variables as being the most plausible basis for a causal theory. The theory is then further tested using 31 pairs of countries with similar income levels and in similar regions, which shows a significant positive correlation between performance and legitimacy. The article concludes with suggestions for further research.},

This transformation has had enormous social and political consequences. In this research note, I assess the influence of both income inequality and the changing structure of income inequality on Americans' public policy mood. Numerous political theorists suggest that rising inequality and the shift in the distribution of income to those at the top should lead to increasing support for liberal policies. But recent evidence contradicts these theories. I empirically evaluate a number of competing theoretical predictions about the relationship between inequality and public preferences. In general, the evidence supports the claim that rising inequality has been a force promoting conservatism in the American public.},

However, new cleavages may be hard to find, because we look in the wrong places for their structural basis: it might just be that their value/normative element is contributing crucially to the structural closure of the groups involved \textendash{} as it did in the case of religion previously. If we take such a possibility into account, several of the contributions to the present volume provide evidence for the emergence of a new value-based cleavage, which has mainly, albeit not exclusively, been driven by the challengers of the New Left and the new populist right.},

The rapid increase in immigration, coupled with the perception of rapid social change and instability, is seen to have presented communities and governments with a range of `new' challenges. In the attendant debates, schools are often presented as part of the solution to these challenges, but much remains unknown about the relationship between schools and community cohesion. This article therefore explores the role of schools as a site of socialisation for children and young people and their role in fostering the attitudes, behaviours and norms that are typically associated with citizens in a cohesive society. This article focuses in particular on the role of school demographics and school climate and uses longitudinal data from students in England to examine these relationships.},

Marketing doctrine also produces legitimization to lessen the tensions between the marketer's claim to legitimacy and other people's belief in this legitimacy. As marketing doctrine develops through incorporation of criticism, it follows that the critical process is a never-ending one.},

This essay contains a reappraisal of empirical research on conflict and cohesion. Behavioral studies of the linkage between domestic and foreign conflict are described in some detail. The consensus of that literature is that internal conflict is externalized only under very restricted conditions. However, in the process of reviewing this research, several important conceptual problems have been identified. Testing has focused on static rather than dynamic manifestations of conflict. Fragmentary indicators have been used to assess conflict at both levels of political interaction, and measurement is further complicated by the question of cross-national validity. In addition, the role of the state and environmental constraints on projection are in need of further exploration. It is recommended that all of these factors be considered in any new model of the conflict nexus that is intended for empirical testing.},

These relations involve a variety of mechanisms identified by Merton, beyond the classical links in which empirical work tests the implications of theories and provides the starting postulates for new theories. To illustrate some of the ways in which theoretical ideas shape empirical work and empirical ideas shape theoretical work, this article discusses the origins, development, and uses of the justice evaluation function. The development of the justice evaluation function exemplifies two of the mechanisms by which empirical work influences theoretical work and shows how theoretical ideas can play a critical role in an outwardly inductivist empirical inquiry. The subsequent development of the theory of distributive justice and of the generalized comparison function and comparison theory leads not only to new testable implications and new empirical procedures but also to new theoretical and empirical questions, whose resolution may, in turn, lead to the development of new theories.},

Findings indicate that the association between the school's aggregate family socioeconomic status (SES) and test scores is much greater in the private-voucher sector than in the public one, resulting in marked socioeconomic stratification of test scores in the Chilean voucher system. We also find that the amount of tuition fees paid by parents in private-voucher schools has no bearing on test scores, after controlling for the socioeconomic makeup of the school. Implications of these findings for educational inequality in the context of a universal voucher system are discussed.},

social stratification as set forth in two previous general papers written in

attention to the forces pressing toward equality in various respects, as well
as the bases o f inequality. The position taken is that the erosion of the
legitimacy o f the traditional bases of inequality has brought to a new level
of prominence vulue-commitment to an essential equality of status of all
members of modern societal communities.
Inequalities. among units of societal structure which are essential in such
fields as economic productivity, authority and power, and culturally bused
competence, must be justified in terms of their contribution to societal func-
tioning. The balancing of the respects in which all members of the societal
community and many of its collective subunits must be held to be equal with
the imperatives of inequality constitutes one of the primary foci of the prob-
lem of integration in modern society. A few suggestions about the mecha-
nisms by which this integrative process can operate are presented.},

In one case the elected supervisor continued to occupy that position and to direct the workers, in the other case, the elected supervisor was replaced by another. The main hypothesis stated that greater group support and greater perceived legitimacy of office would result in more effective influence. It is also expected that the subordinates would be more attracted to the legitimate supervisor. It was hypothesized that in an interdependent situation, an election process would serve to grant to an individual a legitimate right to a supervisory position This would result in the supervisor's having greater power to influence his fellow workers. A supervisor who did not have legitimate power would also be less accepted personally. Two work situations were created, both interdependent and identical with the exception that in one case the supervisor was elected, and in the other the supervisor assumed his position without benefit of election.},

The objective position of individuals, the wealth of nations, and the national level of unemployment all have substantial effects on subjective status. But their effects are muted by the tendency to see oneself as being in the middle of the hierarchy. This has important implications for class identity and democracy.},

Although it is clear that SEM is a powerful tool that is being used to great benefit in psychological research, it is also clear that the applied SEM literature is characterized by some chronic problems and that this literature can be considerably improved by greater attention to these issues.},

Some recent theoretical thought in political science, however, blends elements of these theoretical styles into an older concern with institutions. This new institutionalism emphasizes the relative autonomy of political institutions, possibilities for inefficiency in history, and the importance of symbolic action to an understanding of politics. Such ideas have a resonable empirical basis, but they are not characterized by powerful theoretical forms. Some directions for theoretical research may, however, be identified in institutionalist conceptions of political order.},

I test the world system paradigm as a general theory of development by focussing on three central constructs: world system role, dependency, and development. Data for five networks among 163 countries are used to operationalize world system role. The findings indicate that world system role can be operationalized in terms of role equivalence, yielding results closer to the theoretical model than the more commonly used structural equivalence measures. Contrary to theoretical expectations, world system role was more a function of absolute size of the economy than of level of development. The results weakly support the world system model of economic performance for the period 1980 to 1989. During this period, world system role had weak to moderate effects on several dependency indicators but did not directly affect economic performance. Dependency had a moderate effect on economic performance.},

  abstract = {The class theories of Karl Marx and Ralf Dahrendorf, although subject to much theoretical analysis, largely have been ignored in the dominant lines of quantitative research on status attainment and the political consequences of social stratification. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by drawing out some of the implications of Marx's ownership of the means of production and Dahrendorf's authority for both income inequality and politics, by evaluating these implications empirically and by showing how these conceptions of class can be incorporated into the dominant Blau-Duncan model of status attainment. Using survey data from large national samples in the United States and Great Britain, we show that both Marx's and Dahrendorf's class models have important implications for men's income, increasing by almost half the variance explained by the conventional Blau-Duncan model. The income of American women, in contrast, is little influenced by class and this explains a substantial part of the male-female income gap. As Marx, Dahrendorf, and others predicted, class position has a stronger impact on class identification and politics in Great Britain than in the United States. An analysis of the transfer of class position from one generation to the next in Britain suggests the existence of two overlapping but distinct stratification systems, one a class system rooted in ownership of the means of production and authority, and the other a status system based on education and occupational status.},

A certain opposition runs all the way through this set of definitions.

After rapidly presenting the main characteristics of these two polar extremes, Paul Ricoeur's suggestion that these two conceptions can be united is discussed and illustrated by the concept of the `spirit of capitalism', as defined in the book by Boltanski and Chiapello (1999). It is shown that this constitutes an ideology which is in fact an attempt to encompass both these conceptions. It is also shown that the concept of `trial' as proposed in that book helps greatly to understand how this reconciliation is actually possible.},

It is argued that rank inconsistency does not simultaneously produce both conflicting expectations and feelings of injustice as has been previously thought. Rather, it is hypothesized that conflicting expectations are produced under certain conditions of inconsistency, whereas feelings of injustice are produced under certain other conditions of inconsistency. This hypothesis is based on the development of a model which views differential salience and knowledge of an individual's ranks as central variables determining which process will be produced. In the second part of the paper the results of an experiment are reported which provide some general support for the hypothesis. This support suggests that the conceptions actors use in social behavior are important in explaining reactions to rank inconsistency.

Its unique form and planned place in the center of Thucydides' completed history emphasizes the tragic antinomy of the Greek situation: the insoluble conflict of the two complementary political institutions and philosophies of the small autonomous city state and the Athenian Empire. Written after 404 B.C., the Melian Dialogue is an essential part of Thucydides' main theme: to trace the ideals and realities of Athenian policy as reflected in the erga and the logoi of the Peloponnesian War. The Dialogue, while recognizing the right of the Melians to be what they are, was never intended to be an indictment of the Athenian attitude, which is presented as closely related to the Periclean speeches and as a development of, rather than a deviation from the political thought of Thucydides' ideal statesman.},

Should benefits be equal for all or earnings-related? Traditional arguments in favor of targeting and flat-rate benefits, focusing on the distribution of the money actually transferred, neglect three policy-relevant considerations: (1) The size of redistributive budgets is not fixed but reflects the structure of welfare state institutions. (2) A trade-off exists between the degree of low-income targeting and the size of redistributive budgets. (3) Outcomes of market-based distribution are often more unequal than those of earnings-related social insurance programs. We argue that social insurance institutions are of central importance for redistributive outcomes. Using new data, our comparative analyses of the effects of different institutional types of welfare states on poverty and inequality indicate that institutional differences lead to unexpected outcomes and generate the paradox of redistribution: The more we target benefits at the poor and the more concerned we are with creating equality via equal public transfers to all, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the political attitudes (PA) and religiosity level (RL) of a practitioners sample, comprising 82 psychiatrists, 222 clinical psychologists, and 113 psychiatric social workers, and a students sample comprising 69 B.A. and 65 M.A. students in psychology, and 73 B.A. students in social work, who intended to practice psychotherapy. PAs were measured by the subjects' voting intentions, self-definition, and attitudes toward Capitalism-Socialism and the occupied territories. RL was judged by special measures developed for the Jewish population in Israel, which were adapted for secular psychotherapists. Subjects also defined both themselves and their parents regarding PA and RL. The results are similar to findings of previous studies, indicating that psychotherapists support the political left and conduct a secular way of life. No significant differences were found between practitioners and students regarding PA and RL. A significant decrease in subjects' right-wing attitudes and RL relative to their parents was found. It is suggested that the similarity between practitioners and students regarding PA and RL could imply that supporting the political left and low RL preceded the decision to practice psychotherapy. The therapeutic implications of the differences between therapists and clients regarding PA and RL are also discussed.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Attitudes and perceptions of teacher behavior regarding students' gender roles were investigated. A questionnaire was administered to 221 Israeli teachers and responses were analyzed according to gender and education setting. Results indicate no extreme egalitarian or chauvinistic responses. In general, elementary school and female teachers gave more gender egalitarian responses to questionnaire items in comparison with male and secondary school teachers. Only 15\% of teachers in this sample had attended courses on gender equality. Over 50\% of teachers did not respond to the question concerning their school's gender policy. Those findings may reflect a relative lack of teacher awareness concerning the in-depth nature of gender stereotypes and their overall influences. Results may indicate compulsory courses and seminars on gender self-awareness during teacher training. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Methods to determine the confidence intervals for confounding and suppression effects are proposed based on methods developed for mediated effects. Although the statistical estimation of effects and standard errors is the same, there are important conceptual differences among the three types of effects.},

  abstract = {Models of political participation have begun to incorporate actors who possess ``social preferences.'' However, these models have failed to take into account the potentially incongruent political goals of different social preference types. These goals are likely to play an important role in shaping political behavior. To examine the effect of distinct social preferences on political activity we conducted an experiment in which participants played five rounds of a modified dictator game (Andreoni and Miller 2002). We used the decisions in these games to determine their preference type and mapped these types to reported political activity. Our results show that subjects who were most interested in increasing total welfare in the dictator game were more likely to participate in politics than subjects with selfish preferences, whereas subjects most interested in reducing the difference between their own well-being and the well-being of others were no more likely to participate than subjects with selfish preferences.},

Graduating from cross-sectional to longitudinal designs enables researchers to make more rigorous inferences about the causal relations implied by such models. In this transition, misconceptions and erroneous assumptions are the norm. First, we describe some of the questions that arise (and misconceptions that sometimes emerge) in longitudinal tests of mediational models. We also provide a collection of tips for structural equation modeling (SEM) of mediational processes. Finally, we suggest a series of 5 steps when using SEM to test mediational processes in longitudinal designs: testing the measurement model, testing for added components, testing for omitted paths, testing the stationarity assumption, and estimating the mediational effects.

This field has, in spite of its central importance, been in a notably undeveloped stae. The emergence of a highly generalized conceptual scheme in social theory which has elsewhere been traced by the author suggests the possibility of a more thorough theoretical approach than has hitherto been possible. Social stratification, here regarded as the differential ranking of the human individuals who compose a given social system and their treatment as relatively superior or inferior, may be analyzed in terms of the following classification scheme: (I) membership in a kinship unit, (2) personal qualities, (3) achievements, (4) possessions, (5) authority, and (6) power.},

Moreover, we hypothesized that prescriptive beliefs about merit should have a stronger influence on reactions to the status quo when hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies are weak (vs. strong). In 4 studies, participants' preference for the merit principle and hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were assessed; later, the participants evaluated organizational selection practices that support or challenge the status quo. Participants' prescriptive and descriptive beliefs about merit were separate constructs; only the latter predicted other hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies. In addition, as hypothesized, among participants who weakly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies, the stronger their preference for the merit principle, the more they opposed selection practices that were perceived to be merit violating but the more they supported practices that were perceived to be merit restoring. In contrast, those who strongly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were always motivated to support the status quo, regardless of their preference for the merit principle.},

  title = {School {{Context}} and the {{Gender Gap}} in {{Educational Achievement}}},
  abstract = {s generally under-perform relative to girls in schools throughout the industrialized world. Building on theories about gender identity and reports from prior ethnographic classroom observations, we argue that the school environment channels the conception of masculinity in the peer culture, and thereby either fosters or inhibits the development of anti-school attitudes and behavior among boys. Girls' peer groups, in contrast, do not vary as strongly with the social environment in the extent to which school engagement is stigmatized as ``un-feminine.'' As a consequence, boys are more sensitive to school resources that create a learning oriented environment than are girls. Our analyses use a quasi-experimental research design to estimate the gender difference in the causal effect on test scores, and focus on peer SES as an important school resource. We argue that assignment to 5th grade classrooms within Berlin schools is practically random, and we evaluate this selection process by an examination of Berlin's school regulations, by simulation analysis, and by qualitative interviews with school principles. Estimates of the effect of SES composition on male and female performance strongly support our central hypothesis, and other analyses support our proposed mechanism as the likely explanation of the gender differences in the causal effect.PLEASE GET IN CONTACT WITH THE AUTHORS TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE PAPER!},

  abstract = {The statistical analysis of mediation effects has become an indispensable tool for helping scientists investigate processes thought to be causal. Yet, in spite of many recent advances in the estimation and testing of mediation effects, little attention has been given to methods for communicating effect size and the practical importance of those effect sizes. Our goals in this article are to (a) outline some general desiderata for effect size measures, (b) describe current methods of expressing effect size and practical importance for mediation, (c) use the desiderata to evaluate these methods, and (d) develop new methods to communicate effect size in the context of mediation analysis. The first new effect size index we describe is a residual-based index that quantifies the amount of variance explained in both the mediator and the outcome. The second new effect size index quantifies the indirect effect as the proportion of the maximum possible indirect effect that could have been obtained, given the scales of the variables involved. We supplement our discussion by offering easy-to-use R tools for the numerical and visual communication of effect size for mediation effects.

Both are well suited to situations in which there are two groups or two conditions, whereas the r-type, used in association with focused statistical procedures (contrasts), is also ideal in situations where there are more than two groups or conditions and there are predicted overall patterns to be evaluated. Also discussed are procedures for computing confidence intervals and null-counternull intervals as well as a systematic approach to comparing and combining competing predictions expressed in the form of contrast weights and ES indicators.

Die zentrale These lautet, dass in Gesellschaften mit standardisierten, stratifizierten und differenzierten Bildungssystemen intragenerationale Mobilit{\"a}t durch credentialistische Allokationsprozesse eingeschr{\"a}nkt wird, so dass strukturell privilegierte (beziehungsweise benachteiligte), homogene und stabile soziale Klassen entstehen k{\"o}nnen. Diese suchen ihre Interessen durch kollektives soziales Handeln zu verwirklichen. In Gesellschaften mit unstandardisierten, unstratifizierten und undifferenzierten Bildungssystemen hingegen machen instabile und heterogene soziale Lagen die Entstehung kollektiven sozialen Handelns unwahrscheinlich. Die These wird durch einen internationalen Vergleich der Strukturierung der subjektiven Schichteinstufung anhand von Daten des International Social Justice Project (1991,1996) gepr{\"u}ft. Es zeigt sich, dass erwartungsgem{\"a}{\ss} die subjektive Wahrnehmung sozialer Ungleichheit in credentialistischen L{\"a}ndern st{\"a}rker durch Bildungstitel und Klassenlage strukturiert wird als in nicht credentialistischen. Trotz aller sonst stark betonten Individualisierungstendenzen ist besonders in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland eine ausgepr{\"a}gte Strukturierung der subjektiven Schichteinstufung festzustellen.}

Do CEE citizens believe that inequality is excessive and, if so, why? And what is the connection between perceptions of social inequality and citizens' views of new markets and democracy? These questions are addressed using new data from mass surveys conducted in 2007 in 12 post-communist CEE states. Surprisingly weak links are found between social inequality perceptions and national-level measures of inequality as well economic, social and political conditions. Perceptions of social inequality are mainly driven by individual-level assessments of market and democratic performance, but not by market or democratic ideals.},

  abstract = {Producing more effective governance is the greatest challenge that faces most Latin American democracies today\textemdash{}a challenge that involves not only strengthening democratic institutions but also increasing governmental effectiveness. Focusing on the post-1990 period, this volume addresses why some policies and some countries have been more successful than others in meeting this dual challenge.Two features of the volume stand out. First, whereas some analysts tend to generalize for Latin America as a whole, this group of authors underscores the striking differences of achievement among countries in the region and illustrates the importance of understanding these differences. The second feature is the range of expertise within the volume.In addition to the volume editors, the contributors are Alan Angell, Daniel Brinks, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jos{\'e} de Gregorio, Alejandro Foxley, Evelyne Huber, Jos{\'e} Miguel Insulza, Juliana Mart{\'i}nez Franzoni, Patricio Navia, Francisco Rodriguez, Mitchell Seligson, John Stephens, Jorge Vargas Cullell, and Ignacio Walker.},

  isbn = {978-0-521-40786-1},
  abstract = {In this book John Zaller develops a comprehensive theory to explain how people acquire political information from elites and the mass media and convert it into political preferences. Using numerous specific examples, Zaller applies this theory to the dynamics of public opinion on a broad range of subjects, including domestic and foreign policy, trust in government, racial equality, and presidential approval, as well as voting behaviour in U.S. House, Senate, and presidential elections. The thoery is constructed from four basic premises. The first is that individuals differ substantially in their attention to politics and therefore in their exposure to elite sources of political information. The second is that people react critically to political communication only to the extent that they are knowledgeable about political affairs. The third is that people rarely have fixed attitudes on specific issues; rather, they construct 'preference statements' on the fly as they confront each issue raised. The fourth is that, in constructing these statements, people make the greatest use of ideas that are, for various reasons, the most immediately salient to them. Zaller emphasizes the role of political elites in establishing the terms of political discourse in the mass media and the powerful effect of this framing of issues on the dynamics of mass opinion on any given issue over time.},

  abstract = {"This new volume reviews longitudinal models and analysis procedures for use in the behavioral and social sciences. Written by distinguished experts in the field, the book presents the most current approaches and theories, and the technical problems that may be encountered along the way. Readers will find new ideas about the use of longitudinal analysis in solving problems that arise due to the specific nature of the research design and the data available." "Longitudinal Models in the Behavioral and Related Sciences is divided into two parts. Part One is concerned with the latest theoretical developments. In particular, the book addresses situations that arise due to the categorical nature of the data, issues related to state space modeling, and potential problems that may arise from network analysis and/or growth-curve data. Part Two focuses on the application of longitudinal modeling in a variety of disciplines. The book features applications such as heterogeneity on the patterns of a firm's profit, on house prices, and on delinquent behavior, non-linearity in growth in assessing cognitive aging, measurement error issues in longitudinal research, and distance association for the analysis of change. Part two clearly demonstrates the caution that should be taken when applying longitudinal modeling as well as in the interpretation of the results. Longitudinal Models in the Behavioral and Related Sciences is ideal for advanced students and researchers in psychology, sociology, education, economics, management, medicine, and neuroscience.

There are six categories of political participation: cognitive, expressive, organizational, electoral, partisan, and governmental. In each case, the poor display the lowest and the rich the highest rate of participation. This difference reflects variations in political and psychological resources and the structure of the electoral process. As a result, political benefits also differ by social class.},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to offer an empirical contribution to the debate on the political significance of class, and especially the relationship between class position and political participation. The `death of class' debate has primarily addressed only one aspect of politics \textemdash{} voting. The perspective offered here widens the scope of analysis to include the main forms of political action available to citizens in modern democracies. In this article, a comparative cross-national approach is adopted, using data on 20 European countries that are included in the first wave of the European Social Survey. Using log-linear models as a descriptive device, the article identifies a basic pattern of association between class and participation, points out the main national deviations from that pattern and makes a comparative assessment of the relative magnitude of overall levels of class inequalities in participation in different forms of political activity. The results bear out the continuing relevance of class as a source of differentiation of political behaviour and tend to confirm previous research regarding the validity of empirical generalizations on class patterns of political participation.},

These programs include state reform that redefines social policy and the role of state, markets and families in the satisfaction of social needs. This dual social policy aims at commodifying profitable social services and benefits and reducing public social services to a minimum for the very poor. These characteristics are analyzed specifically in the health services and social insurance reforms and poverty programs. Given the sustained increase in poverty and unemployment and falling family incomes, this policy aggravates the social crisis through simultaneous market and state `failure'.},

Three approaches have been used to explain the inconsistent findings of the EI-PC (Economic Inequality-Political Conflict) nexus: statistical modeling, formal modeling, and theory building. Because analysts have tended to possess different research skills, these three approaches have been employed in isolation from one another. Singly, however, all three approaches have proved deficient and are unlikely to solve the EI-PC puzzle. The most fruitful approach is to combine the assumptions of the theory builders and the deductive approach of the formal modelers with the various empirical tests of the statistical modelers. Such an approach to the EI-PC puzzle produces a crucial test of the Deprived Actor and Rational Actor theories of conflict. The approach is also our best hope for solving the other long-standing puzzles in conflict studies.},

This study assesses the effects of social-welfare policy extensiveness on poverty rates across fifteen affluent industrialized nations over the period 1960-91, using both absolute and relative measures of poverty. The results strongly support the conventional view that social-welfare programs reduce poverty.},

Our study consists of three related experiments that examine how individuals use four distinct allocation principles derived from both normative and empirical research-equality, merit, need, and efficiency-under a condition of impartiality. Our experiments are designed to investigate these principles and to determine how independent factors influence how individuals use them. We find that individuals tend to use all or most of these principles simultaneously in making distributive justice judgments, but that they weigh them differently according to various factors. In particular, we find an expectedly strong difference between how women and men use and weigh these principles. This gender difference parallels-and may even underlie- the gender gap observed in political and policy preferences. CR - Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 Midwest Political Science Association},

One of the most consistently documented relationships in the field of
political behavior is the close association between educational attainment and
political participation. Although most research assumes that this association arises
because education causes participation, it could also arise because education proxies
for the factors that lead to political engagement: the kinds of people who participate
in politics may be the kinds of people who tend to stay in school. To test for a causal
effect of education, we exploit the rise in education levels among males induced by
the Vietnam draft. We find little reliable evidence that education induced by the
draft significantly increases participation rates.},

I return to an enumeration of the informational requirements for assessing legitimacy in hopes of finding a conceptualization that better utilizes available survey indicators to tap relevant macro dimensions. I specify formal measurement models for both conventional and revised conceptualizations of legitimacy orientations and compare the fit of the two models systematically on data from the U.S. electorate.

According to the mediation hypothesis, the effect of personality on political participation is mediated by classical predictors, such as political interest, internal efficacy, political discussion, or the sense that voting is a civic duty. This paper outlines various paths that link personality traits to two participatory activities: voter turnout in European Parliament elections and participation in protest actions. The hypotheses are tested with data from a large, nationally representative, face-to-face survey of the Spanish population conducted before and after the 2009 European Parliament elections using log-linear path models that are well suited to study indirect relationships. The results clearly confirm that the effects of personality traits on voter turnout and protest participation are sizeable but indirect. They are mediated by attitudinal predictors.},

Two forms of participation, namely active political participation and the more passive psychological involvement of citizens in the democratic process, were treated as separate but related facets of participation. Four competing models were advanced and tested. The data were collected from 434 citizens in the north of Israel who were interviewed by questionnaire. The analysis was performed by structural equations modeling with LISREL VIII. The findings show that the relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation can be better understood as being mediated by personal variables rather than direct. This is demonstrated by the many nonsignificant paths in the direct model. The findings also reveal that active political participation and psychological involvement are distinct but related constructs, where involvement leads to active participation. In addition, all research variables were related more strongly to psychological involvement than to active political participation. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for future research on political participation.},

In this article, we analyze change in a core set of societal norms\textemdash{}beliefs in distributive justice\textemdash{}in the Czech Republic over the last two decades, and locate those trends in regional perspective. What we find is that, over time, the negative association between egalitarian and meritocratic norms has increasingly strengthened, suggesting a crystallization of those norms as opposing value sets. In addition, attachments to those norms are increasingly structured by respondents' socio-economic status. In order words, the research confirms that subjective norms in the Czech Republic are increasingly shaped by objective social status in ways common in advanced democracies, and that we can speak not only of a crystallization of the value system, but of a corresponding ``re-stratification'' of justice beliefs in relation to social position.},

As the meritocratic argument that education is strongly linked to certain rewards in the labour market comes under pressure, increasing social dissatisfaction with education and skills wastage could be expected, as already noted in part of the political economy literature. This literature, however, has tended to conclude from such observations that educational expansion cannot deliver equality. The paper contributes to the debate by focusing on the opportunities created by current trends for the reorganisation of the relationship between education, the economy and society.},

  abstract = {This study uses regression analysis of data from a telephone survey of 380 married couples to subject to rare empirical test the contention that, because women are unequal at home, they cannot be equal in the polity. The argument is often made that wives' disadvantage in comparison to their husbands with respect to control over family income, availability of free time, power over decisions, or mutual respect dampens their ability to participate fully in politics. In fact, domestic inequalities do have implications for political activity, but these effects differ from what is usually posited by being stronger for husbands than for wives. For husbands, control over major financial decisions and autonomy in using small amounts of time enhance their ability to participate in politics beyond what would be expected on the basis of their other characteristics. In short, being boss at home is politically empowering to husbands.},

But there is little clarity in policy discussions about what social cohesion means and how education may affect it. In this article we distinguish between social capital and societal cohesion and argue that education acts in differential ways on each. Using comparative, cross-country analysis, we develop a 'distributional model' which shows the relationship between equality of educational outcomes and various measures of social cohesion. In the final part of the article we discuss theories explaining the cross-country trends and variations in educational inequality and social inheritance in education, and argue that education system characteristics, such as degrees of 'comprehensiveness' in secondary schooling, may be an important factor in both. We conclude by arguing that policies to increase social cohesion through education must pay more attention to the reduction of educational equality than they currently do.},

Under reasonable assumptions, the baseline model produces an equilibrium with the extent of redistributive taxation chosen by the median income earner. If the median is poorer than average, redistribution is from rich to poor, and increasing inequality increases redistribution. However, under different assumptions about the economic environment, redistribution may not be simply rich to poor, and inequality need not increase redistribution. Several lines of argument are presented, in particular, political participation, public provision of private goods, public pensions, and tax avoidance or evasion.},

I use the Current Population Survey to create direct measures of the income of the median voter to investigate its effect on spending and its relationship with inequality and turnout. In the 50 US states from 1978 to 2002, I find little effect of these direct measures on redistributive outcomes; nor do the individual characteristics of the median voter appear to mediate the effects of turnout and inequality measured at the state level. Thus I find no support for the contention that turnout affects government spending via increasing the political representation of the poor. In contrast to cross-national findings, across US states the income of the median voter is not strongly affected by turnout, but rather by other state characteristics.},

Four broad areas of development were identified. First, critiques of self-report questionnaires and the development of new and psychometrically improved measures of BJW and related concepts were reviewed. Second, an extension of the studies of victim derogation and devaluation, particularly to those with AIDs and those who have experienced traumatic events such as rape, were discussed. Third, comparative recent research looking at BJW as a coping mechanism that may both buffer stress and facilitate achievement striving was reviewed. This focused on both the function and potential benefits of the BJW. Fourth an examination of cultural and demographic differences in the distribution of BJW was reviewed. There seems to be a movement from stressing the negative consequences of the BJW to understanding its psychological beneficial functions. It is concluded that the new direction in BJW research will ensure survival of research into the phenomenon for many years to come.},

Previous findings have shown that BJW is positively related to the value domains conformity and security as well as to extraversion and negatively to neuroticism and openness. In this study, a negative correlation between BJW and openness to new experience was found. Furthermore BJW correlated positively with security and conformity. A cluster analysis on BJW and the value domains revealed three types: value-conscious (high in all values and low in BJW), dependent-just (high in BJW, security and conformity, low in self-direction) and self-directed (only high in self-direction). Value-conscious and dependent-just participants showed higher scores on conscientiousness, whereas self-directed participants scored higher in openness. Further research should take into account the individual function of BJW and values for personality functioning.},

We argue that family structure has become an important mechanism for the reproduction of class, race, and gender inequalities. We review studies of income inequality and family structure changes and find a wide range of estimates of the correlation. We discuss how increases in income inequality may lead to increases in single motherhood, particularly among less educated women. Single motherhood in turn decreases intergenerational economic mobility by affecting children's material resources and the parenting they experience. Because of the unequal distribution of family structure by race and the negative effects of single motherhood, family structure changes exacerbate racial inequalities. Gender inequalities also increase as mothers incur more child-related costs and fewer fathers experience family life with children.},

In the case of the police, the inability to effectively control crime is frequently seen as driving public evaluations.

Drawing upon psychological research about public evaluations of institutions and authorities it is argued that the key issue that shapes public views is a process based evaluation of the fairness of the procedures that the police and courts use to exercise their authority. Analyses from several studies exploring the basis of public views support this procedural justice based model of public evaluation. In addition, the results provide suggestions about the elements of procedures that are central to public judgments about their fairness. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In particular, they examine the role of perceived injustice in creating dislike for and distrust of leaders and institutions. This focus upon justice is contrasted with the more traditional focus upon the level of outcomes received from the political system and upon congruence in citizen-leader policy preferences. The results strongly support a focus upon justice by showing that judgments of injustice exercise an influence upon leadership evaluations and in stitutional endorsements which is independent of beliefs about the level of outcomes the political system is providing to citizens or of public support for government policies. In fact, both studies suggest that judgments of justice or injustice have more influence upon the endorsement of political leaders and institutions than do outcome-related concerns.},

Political theory often attributes democratic legitimacy to the fairness of the processes by which collective decisions are taken; empirical research by contrast has primarily investigated whether citizens' approval of democratic institutions derives from satisfaction with the substantive output of those institutions. This article examines whether assessments of decision-making processes shape public willingness to consent to authority. The role of procedural fairness in institutional legitimacy has previously only been investigated in the context of the United States, and has fallen short of demonstrating that procedural assessments actually have a causal effect on institutional legitimacy. Panel survey data of attitudes in a large-scale land use issue provide the empirical base of the analysis. The results indicate that assessments of procedural fairness have a bearing on two conceptualizations of subjective legitimacy: respondents' trust for the authority and their willingness to accept a decision outcome.},

people are less politically engaged in societies with higher income inequality\textemdash{}

relationship; the association could be spurious, or due to reverse-causality, given that
other research suggests that disengagement contributes to higher inequality. Using
multilevel models fitted to data on the frequency of political discussion from all five
waves of the World/European Values Surveys, this paper re-assesses the thesis of a
causal relationship, in two ways. First, I investigate whether the relationship holds not
just cross-sectionally but also longitudinally. Second, I use an instrument for
inequality to test whether the correlation between inequality and discussion holds
even when ruling out reverse-causality. I find mixed evidence for a relationship over
time, but a clear correlation when instrumenting for inequality.},

Open-ended interviews were conducted with teachers (N = 25) in prekindergarten through sixth grades. Results indicated that while socioeconomic status (SES) was the most frequently mentioned domain of student difference, teachers were unsure about how to effectively address SES in the classroom. Some teachers reported working (unsuccessfully) to mask SES differences among students, though this became increasingly difficult in the upper elementary grades. Additionally, teachers described challenges associated with having an economically heterogeneous student body including parents' differential power and involvement at the school and the lack of geographic proximity among students. Findings highlight the need for clear and specific classroom- and school-based strategies to better address SES differences among students in socioeconomically integrated school settings.

Variations of factor analysis, such as the factoring of people or time, have great potential to inform psychological research. The author presents highly technical material in an appealing and accessible manner. The book is unique in that it presents both exploratory and confirmatory methods within the single category of the general linear model (GLM). Canons of best factor analytic practice are presented and explained. An actual data set, generated by 100 graduate students and 100 faculty from the United States and Canada, is used throughout the book, allowing readers to replicate reported results and explore variations on reported analyses. Different combinations of these variables and participants are used to illustrate EFA and CFA applications. The book also includes a glossary, a notation summary, and various SPSS syntax files that readers may use to implement elegant factor analytic solutions.},

  abstract = {This article examines the nature of and change in beliefs about inequality and preferences for redistribution in South Africa between 2003 and 2012 using data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey series and 2009 round of the International Social Survey Programme. Inequality aversion, stratification beliefs, perceptions of class tensions and legitimate earnings are tracked, together with support for government redistribution and for specific redress policies. Overall, the findings portray South Africans as keenly aware of the economic inequality that beleaguers their society, and express a preference for greater distributive fairness. Broad support is also reported in relation to state-led redistribution, though a moderate declining trend is observed over the interval. Race and class differences characterise the survey results, though a majority of better-off South Africans (white, tertiary educated and non-poor citizens) still tend to be inequality averse and voice support for redistribution. Greater polarisation is evident with respect to inequality-related social policy, especially those designed to overcome historical racial disadvantage, though these intergroup differences converge considerably when referring to class-based policy measures. One surprising finding is the evidence that South Africa's youngest generation, known as the `Born Frees', tend to adopt a similar predisposition to redress policy as older generations, thus confounding expectations of a post-apartheid value change. Nonetheless, even though South Africans may not fully agree about the specific elements comprising a socially just response to the country's inequality problem, there does seem to be a stronger basis for a social compact for an inequality reduction agenda than is typically assumed.},

There were some variations, but in general, for all societies researched, a majority estimated the distribution of wages to be unjust at the extremes: in their eyes, unskilled workers are paid too little and, even more clearly, executives are paid too much. The average income of the middle class employee is considered to be just by a (weak) majority, with regional exceptions. Interestingly, though perhaps not amazingly, almost all persons asked estimated their own income to be too low (at most, in some cases, just adequate), regardless of their position (executive, unskilled worker or other). With regard to public debate this data shows that Social Justice cannot simply be reduced to the question of equality of opportunity.},

This is troubling as these attitudes and orientations are part of what constitute a healthy democratic political culture and thus germane to the long-term legitimacy of both national and EU governance.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT There is an odd proximity between Hayek, hero of the libertarian right, and Rawls, theorist of social justice, because, at the level of principle, Hayek was in some important respects a Rawlsian. Although Hayek said that the idea of social justice was nonsense, he argued against only a particular principle of social justice, one that Rawls too rejected, namely distribution according to individual merit. Any attempt to make reward and merit coincide, Hayek argued, would undermine the market's price system, leaving us all poorer and less free. Like Rawls, Hayek held that we should assess social institutions from behind a veil of ignorance, and he thought that doing so pushed us toward egalitarianism. Most of the distance between Hayek and Rawls at the level of policy stems from Hayek's optimism about the operation of markets, his equivocation about the meaning of central concepts, and his appeal to under-argued slippery slopes. Hayek wavered, however, between claiming that private property and markets benefit everyone, compared to the feasible alternatives, and the principle that they maximize the opportunities of a randomly selected member of society, i.e., aggregate opportunity. Contemporary Hayekians claim that capitalism raises the position of the worst off in the long run, in future generations, whereas Rawlsians insist that inequalities between social positions should benefit the worst off now.},

Using a synthetic cohort design to generate panel data at the level of socio-demographic groups, analysis of fives waves of data from the European Social Survey (2002\textendash{}2010) shows that differences across countries in macroeconomic and social conditions have an effect on the demand for redistribution. Consistent with theoretical expectations, economic growth generates a lower demand for redistribution, while higher income inequality generates a higher demand. By contrast, differences across countries in unemployment levels and social expenditure are unrelated to the demand for redistribution. The analysis also suggests that empirical results depend to a considerable extent on the assumptions underlying different methodological approaches.},

  abstract = {This article examines the nature of and change in beliefs about inequality and preferences for redistribution in South Africa between 2003 and 2012 using data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey series and 2009 round of the International Social Survey Programme. Inequality aversion, stratification beliefs, perceptions of class tensions and legitimate earnings are tracked, together with support for government redistribution and for specific redress policies. Overall, the findings portray South Africans as keenly aware of the economic inequality that beleaguers their society, and express a preference for greater distributive fairness. Broad support is also reported in relation to state-led redistribution, though a moderate declining trend is observed over the interval. Race and class differences characterise the survey results, though a majority of better-off South Africans (white, tertiary educated and non-poor citizens) still tend to be inequality averse and voice support for redistribution. Greater polarisation is evident with respect to inequality-related social policy, especially those designed to overcome historical racial disadvantage, though these intergroup differences converge considerably when referring to class-based policy measures. One surprising finding is the evidence that South Africa's youngest generation, known as the `Born Frees', tend to adopt a similar predisposition to redress policy as older generations, thus confounding expectations of a post-apartheid value change. Nonetheless, even though South Africans may not fully agree about the specific elements comprising a socially just response to the country's inequality problem, there does seem to be a stronger basis for a social compact for an inequality reduction agenda than is typically assumed.},

However, understanding of the processes and contexts in which early adolescents become civically engaged is still limited. This study draws on a sample of approximately 4,000 students from 11 urban middle schools in Tennessee to address several gaps in the civic engagement literature. First, we use latent class analysis to identify types of civic engagement in early adolescence. Second, we explore associations between types of engagement and youth behavioral and academic outcomes. Third, we focus on urban youth. A latent class analysis using survey items suggests a three-class structure for civic engagement in urban middle schools. One distinction is between students who are engaged and those who are not. Another distinction is that, among the engaged groups, one is engaged both behaviorally and attitudinally (social justice actors), whereas another has strong civic attitudes but infrequent civic behaviors (social justice sympathizers).},

Two distinct orientations were found, termed here as `liberal' and `ethno-republican'. In order to contextualize the examination of citizenship orientations in the deeply divided Israeli society, the study compares three educational sectors that represent these rifts. Findings suggest that citizenship orientations are context-bound, in the sense that they depend upon the educational sector. As expected, ethno-republican orientations were more salient among religious Jewish students than among either secular Jewish or Israeli Arab students. Secular Jewish and Israeli Arab students tend more strongly to endorse the liberal orientation, a propensity that is especially manifest among Arab adolescents. This trend supports the perception that Israeli-Jewish population is bifurcated.},

It is based on the premise that system affect is a more important antecedent of aggressive political behavior than incumbent affect. The data reported here show that it is possible to distinguish incumbent from system affect empirically, and also theoretically important to make the incumbent-system distinction. Measures especially sensitive to incumbent affect correlate differently with ideology than does a measure especially sensitive to system affect. Byvariate correlations between measures of incumbent affect and a measure of aggressive political behavior are shown to be either spurious or indirect, due to the fact that incumbent affect is correlated with what appears to be a more powerful and direct antecedent of aggressive political behavior, namely, system affect. The theory behind the incumbent-system distinction is expressed in four propositions. In general, the data conform to it, but each prediction is qualified according to whether ideology and community context are inhibitory or facilitative.},

We get four interpretations because a neglected ambiguity in `opportunity' intersects a well-known ambiguity in `equality.' The neglected ambiguity holds between substantive and non-substantive conceptions of `opportunity' and the well-known ambiguity holds between comparative and non-comparative conceptions of `equality.' Among other things, distinguishing these four interpretations reveals how misleading `equal opportunity for advantage' formulations of luck egalitarianism can be. These formulations are misleading in so far as they obscure the difference between two separate claims about which inequalities are consistent with true equality. Luck egalitarianism claims that inequalities that have been chosen in some suitable sense are consistent with true equality, while the traditional ideal of equality of opportunity only claims that inevitable inequalities that have been determined through fair competitions are consistent with true equality. Obscuring the difference between these two claims therefore serves both to arrogate the rhetorical advantages of the traditional ideal to luck egalitarianism and to cover over a limitation to luck egalitarianism's ambition to provide a comprehensive principle of distributive justice.},

Indeed, social movement scholars generally agree that a key component of most, if not all, social movements is a shared belief that existing conditions are unfair and subject to change (Gamson 1992; McAdam 1982; Snow et al. 1986; Turner and Killian 1987). In this article we consider the role that residential segregation by education level plays in shaping perceptions of distributive justice and, in turn, providing a context conducive to conservative political mobilization. We apply these ideas in an analysis of Tea Party activism and show that educational segregation is a strong predictor of the number of Tea Party organizations in U.S. counties. In a complementary analysis, we find that individuals with a bachelor's degree are more likely than people who do not have any college education to support the Tea Party; this relationship is strongest in counties with higher levels of educational segregation.},

This provokes many a criticism and misunderstanding. Such a theory may not correspond with the model of social psychology as it is defined at present. One attempts however to show that it answers important social and scientific questions, in what it differs from the classical conception of collective representations and, from the very beginning, adopts a constructivist perspective which has spread in social psychology since. Several trends of research have confirmed its vision of the relations between social and cognitive phenomena, communication and thought. More detailed remarks aim at outlining the nature of social representations, their capacity to create information, their function which is to familiarize us with the strange, according to the categories of our culture. Going farther, one insists on the diversity of methodological approaches. If the experimental method is useful to understand how people should think, higher mental and social processes must be approached by different methods, including linguistic analysis and observation of how people think. No doubt, social representations have a relation with the more recent field of social cognition. But inasmuch as the former depend on content and context, i.e. subjectivity and sociability of people, they approach the phenomena differently from the latter. Referring to child psychology and anthropology, one can contend, despite appearances, that it is also a more scientific approach. There is however much to be learned from criticisms and there is still a long way to go before we arrive at a satisfactory theory of social thinking and communication.},

  abstract = {In democratic societies, opinion polls play a vital role. But it has been demonstrated that many people do not have an opinion about major issues--the "nonattitudes" problem. Also, the framing of questions in different ways can generate very different estimates of public opinion--the "framing" effect. Both dilemmas raise questions about the competence of ordinary citizens to play the role a democratic society ostensibly expects of them. Although the impact of some factors is well established, particularly political information and sophistication, much is yet to be understood. Building on and reaching beyond themes in the work of Philip Converse, one of the pioneers in the study of public opinion, Studies in Public Opinion brings together a group of leading American and European social scientists to explore a number of new factors, with a particular emphasis on the structure of political choices. In twelve chapters that reflect different perspectives on how people form political opinions and how these opinions are manipulated, this book offers an unparalleled view of the state-of-the-art research on these important questions as it has developed on two continents.

Support for tax systems is bimodal within the income classes, with the richest 5\% being the most supportive, and the median in a population being second. Ideological values have a strong impact on political support for redistribution across all income classes.

As a result, individuals who are religious are predicted to prefer lower levels of social insurance than will individuals who are secular. To the extent policy outcomes reflect individual preferences, then countries with higher levels of religiosity should have lower levels of welfare state spending. In formalizing our argument we also suggest that if benefits from religion are subject to a network externality (I derive greater pleasure from religion when others are also religious), it is possible for countries that are similar in terms of underlying conditions to exhibit multiple equilibria with respect to religion and social insurance. We empirically test our predictions using individual-level data on religiosity, individual-level data on social insurance preferences, and cross-country data on social spending outcomes. The findings are strongly supportive of our hypotheses.},

In doing so, it identifies an important distinction between preferences over the level of taxation and preferences over its structure. Using individual-level survey data from 17 advanced industrial countries, I find `decoupling' of pro-redistributive attitudes over the size versus the shape of government. The modal respondent prefers higher progressivity (more redistribution) but lower tax levels (less redistribution). Further, this decoupling varies across countries: preferences over tax levels have a greater effect on progressivity preferences in less progressive tax systems. I examine how theories of redistribution preferences help understand this disconnect, and show that income and risk affect progressivity preferences as they do attitudes towards redistribution. In contrast, trust affects preferences over tax levels in the same way as it affects redistribution preferences.},

We conclude by discussing several explanations for the apparent discrepancy between these results and the pattern of null findings characteristic of the self-interest literature.},

  abstract = {Rising income inequality has been a defining trend of the past generation, yet we know little about its impact on social policy formation. We evaluate two dominant views about public opinion on rising inequality: that Americans do not care much about inequality of outcomes, and that a rise in inequality will lead to an increase in demand for government redistribution. Using time series data on views about income inequality and social policy preferences in the 1980s and 1990s from the General Social Survey, we find little support for these views. Instead, Americans do tend to object to inequality and increasingly believe government should act to redress it, but not via traditional redistributive programs. We examine several alternative possibilities and provide a broad analytical framework for reinterpreting social policy preferences in the era of rising inequality. Our evidence suggests that Americans may be unsure or uninformed about how to address rising inequality and thus swayed by contemporaneous debates. However, we also find that Americans favor expanding education spending in response to their increasing concerns about inequality. This suggests that equal opportunity may be more germane than income redistribution to our understanding of the politics of inequality.},

  abstract = {Tax evasion is a widespread phenomenon and encouraging tax compliance is an important and debated policy issue. Many studies have shown that tax cheating has to be attributed to a considerable extent to the tax morale of taxpayers. The aim of the present paper is to shed light on the relationship between the taxpayer and the public sector; specifically, we investigate whether public spending inefficiency shapes individual tax morale. Combining data from Italian municipalities' balance sheets with individual data from a properly designed survey on tax morale, we find that the attitude towards paying taxes is better when resources are spent more efficiently. This evidence seems not to be driven by some confounding factor at the municipality level or by spatial sorting of citizens and proves robust to accounting for alternative measures of both inefficiency and tax morale. We also find that the negative effect of inefficiency is larger if the level of public spending is lower and/or the degree of fiscal autonomy is higher.},

Similarly, arguments proposing that advanced welfare statism has undesirable effects on civic morality, such as cheating on taxes and benefits, are not supported empirically.

Leslie McCall contends that such assumptions are based on both incomplete survey data and economic conditions of the past and not present. In fact, Americans have desired less inequality for decades, and McCall's book explains why. Americans become most concerned about inequality in times of inequitable growth, when they view the rich as prospering while opportunities for good jobs, fair pay, and high quality education are restricted for everyone else. As a result, they favor policies to expand opportunity and redistribute earnings in the workplace, reducing inequality in the market rather than redistributing income after the fact with tax and spending policies. This book resolves the paradox of how Americans can express little enthusiasm for welfare state policies and still yearn for a more equitable society and forwards a new model of preferences about income inequality rooted in labor market opportunities rather than welfare state policies.},

Our theoretical analysis leads to two testable predictions. First, an individual's tax morale is higher, the more progressive the tax schedule is.

In our empirical analysis we make use of a unique dataset of tax progressivity measures, namely the World Tax Indicators, and follow most of the tax morale literature by employing the World Values Survey to measure individual tax morale.

  abstract = {In cross-sectional studies, countries with greater income inequality typically exhibit less support for government-led redistribution and greater acceptance of wage inequality (e.g., United States versus Western Europe). If individual nations evolve along this pattern, a vicious cycle could form with reduced social concern amplifying primal increases in inequality due to forces like skill-biased technical change. Exploring movements around these long-term levels, however, this study finds mixed evidence regarding the vicious cycle hypothesis. On one hand, larger compensation differentials are accepted as inequality grows. This growth in differentials is of a smaller magnitude than the actual increase in inequality, but it is nonetheless positive and substantial in size. Weighing against this, growth in inequality is met with greater support for government-led redistribution to the poor. These patterns suggest that short-run inequality shocks can be reinforced in the labor market but do not result in weaker political preferences for redistribution.},

We first analyze a cross-section of individuals in Spain and the United States. In line with previous experimental results, our findings indicate a significantly higher tax morale in the United States than in Spain, controlling in a multivariate analysis for additional variables. We then extend our multivariate analysis to include an additional 14 European countries. Our results again indicate that individuals in the United States have the highest tax morale across all countries, followed by Austria and Switzerland. We also find a strong negative correlation between the size of shadow economy and the degree of tax morale in those countries.},

Furthermore, people who said they knew/have heard about practised tax avoidance have a significantly lower tax morale than others. Looking at individuals' perception of reasons for tax evasion we found that the tax burden, lacking honesty, and corruption are seen as the main factors. We observed a significantly lower tax morale in South America/ Mexico than in the Central American/Caribbean area. Furthermore, trust in the president and the officials, the belief that other individuals obey the law and a pro democratic attitude have a significant positive effect on tax morale.},

  abstract = {In this article we analyze preferences for tax schemes, using data on subjective evaluations of the taxes paid by different income groups. We estimate multilevel models to test the effect of socio-economic status and political ideology on individual preferences. We find that both self-interest motivations and political ideology are important factors in explaining preferences for tax schemes. At the national level, it is found that the fiscal burden shapes preferences for tax schemes (especially direct taxation) and it has an interacting effect with both self-interest and ideological variables. At higher levels of direct taxation, probabilities of supporting redistribution toward the poor and the rich become highly polarized along political affiliations. This suggests a mobilization effect. As direct taxation increases, left-wing parties strengthen their ability to mobilize their electorates to pursue further their redistributive interests, while right-wing voters increase their resistance to taxing the rich.},

Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with respondents from higher and lower social classes, the paper reconstructs the `moral economy' that underlies popular views of inequality. While respondents agree with abstract inegalitarian principles\textemdash{}i.e. income differentiation based on merit\textemdash{}they are concerned with specific instances of inequality, especially poverty and wealth. These are criticized because they are seen to imply intolerable deviations, both upwards and downwards, from a way of living presumed as universal, thereby fostering a segregation of life-worlds and social disintegration. Thus, perceptions of injustice do not seem to be based on the existence of income inequality as such, but rather on the view that economic disparities threaten the social bond.},

  abstract = {Prejudice is more prevalent among members of the working class than among members of the middle or upper class. It is still a matter of discussion whether education works to suppress prejudice among upper class members or, on the contrary, to enhance genuinely tolerant attitudes. We propose that (i) two indicators of social class\textemdash{}income and education\textemdash{}independently predict prejudice toward multiple targets as follows: lower levels of income and education are associated with higher levels of prejudice. (ii) The connection between social class and prejudice is explained by the endorsement of system-legitimating ideological attitudes, namely right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). We tested these hypotheses in four studies using cross-sectional surveys in Europe (Studies 1 and 2, Ns\,=\,11\,330 and 2640) and longitudinal data from Germany and Chile (Studies 3 and 4, Ns\,=\,343 and 388). Results show that education and income exert independent negative effects on prejudice. The effect of education is stronger than the effect of income, which is not stable across countries. The relationships between income and prejudice and education and prejudice are mediated by RWA and SDO. We conclude that people of the working class generally endorse an ideological configuration that is well suited for legitimating the social system.

In Study 2, we manipulated the longevity of the Indian caste system and recruited both Indians and Americans. Both groups judged the caste system as more justifiable and legitimate when it was described as more longstanding. In addition, Indians reported more system dependence and judged the caste system as more justifiable and legitimate than Americans.

Superordinate identification increased the justification of unequal funding by members of the disadvantaged group (Study 1) and the acceptance of displaying religious symbols in public places among non-believers (Study 2). In contrast, identification with the low-status subgroup decreased perceived legitimacy of unequal intergroup arrangements. The results demonstrate that superordinate identification can have a negative influence on willingness to act in line with subgroup interest among members of disadvantaged groups.

  abstract = {Modern society is rife with inequality. People's interpretations of these inequalities, however, vary considerably: Different people can interpret, for example, the existing gender gap in wages as being the result of systemic discrimination, or as being the fair and natural result of genuine differences between men and women. Here, we examine one factor that may help explain differing interpretations of existing social inequalities: perceptions of system stability. System justification theory proposes that people are often motivated to rationalize and justify the systems within which they operate, legitimizing whatever social inequalities are present within them. We draw on theories and evidence of rationalization more broadly to predict that people should be most likely to legitimize inequalities in their systems when they perceive those systems as stable and unchanging. In one study, participants who witnessed stability, rather than change, in the domain of gender equality in business subsequently reported less willingness to support programs designed to redress inequalities in completely unrelated domains. In a second study, exposure to the mere concept of stability, via a standard priming procedure, led participants to spontaneously produce legitimizing, rather than blaming, explanations for existing gender inequality in their country. This effect, however, emerged only among politically liberal participants. These findings contribute to an emerging body of research that aims to identify the conditions that promote, and those which prevent, system-justifying tendencies.

The author examined the status-legitimacy hypothesis using data from 3 representative sets of data from the United States (American National Election Studies and General Social Surveys) and throughout the world (World Values Survey; total N across studies = 151,794). Multilevel models revealed that the average effect across years in the United States and countries throughout the world was most often directly contrary to the status-legitimacy hypothesis or was practically zero. In short, the status-legitimacy effect is not a robust phenomenon. Two theoretically relevant moderator variables (inequality and civil liberties) were also tested, revealing weak evidence, null evidence, or contrary evidence to the dissonance-inspired status-legitimacy hypothesis. In sum, the status-legitimacy effect is not robust and is unlikely to be the result of dissonance. These results are used to discuss future directions for research, the current state of SJT, and the interpretation of theoretically relevant but contrary and null results.},

In line with the theoretical literature, we find that both standards are relevant for shaping people's ideas on just earnings. However, there seems to be greater consensus among our respondents on the importance attached to the existential standards than over that attached to the ideal standards. We also found a ``reversed just gender wage gap'': by assigning higher earnings to fictitious female than fictitious male employees, our female and male respondents seem to compensate former gender-related income discrimination against female employees in the German labor market.

There are obvious dangers and disadvantages in this process: 1. it is error-prone due to too much manual work; 2. it requires lots of human efforts to do tedious jobs such as copying results across documents; 3. the workflow is barely recordable especially when it involves GUI (Graphical User Interface) operations, therefore it is difficult to reproduce; 4. a tiny change of the data source in the future will require the author(s) to go through the same procedure again, which can take nearly the same amount of time and effort; 5. the analysis and writing are separate, so close attention has to be paid to the synchronization of the two parts; In fact, a report can be generated dynamically from program code. Just like a software package has its source code, a dynamic document is the source code of a report. It is a combination of computer code and the corresponding narratives. When we compile the dynamic document, the program code in it is executed and replaced with the output; we get a final report by mixing the code output with the narratives. Because we only manage the source code, we are free of all the possible problems above. For example, we can change a single parameter in the source code, and get a different report on the fly."--},

  abstract = {To understand the mechanisms behind social inequality, this address argues that we need to more thoroughly incorporate the effects of status\textemdash{}inequality based on differences in esteem and respect\textemdash{}alongside those based on resources and power. As a micro motive for behavior, status is as significant as money and power. At a macro level, status stabilizes resource and power inequality by transforming it into cultural status beliefs about group differences regarding who is ``better'' (esteemed and competent). But cultural status beliefs about which groups are ``better'' constitute group differences as independent dimensions of inequality that generate material advantages due to group membership itself. Acting through micro-level social relations in workplaces, schools, and elsewhere, status beliefs bias evaluations of competence and suitability for authority, bias associational preferences, and evoke resistance to status challenges from low-status group members. These effects accumulate to direct members of higher status groups toward positions of resources and power while holding back lower status group members. Through these processes, status writes group differences such as gender, race, and class-based life style into organizational structures of resources and power, creating durable inequality. Status is thus a central mechanism behind durable patterns of inequality based on social differences.},

  shorttitle = {The Social Maximum},
  abstract = {In light of the dramatic rise in income inequality at the top of the income distribution, this study investigates how the American public is reacting to extremely high incomes. Tolerance for high incomes is measured using survey items about a cap on compensation. The paper aims to answer the following questions: What do people think about compensation caps? What are the determinants of favoring a cap and favoring various levels of caps? Do characteristics of high earners affect these preferences? Why do people favor or oppose a cap on compensation? Analyses show that 61\% of Americans support a cap on compensation and that this support for a cap is remarkably stable even when high earners are described as being exceptionally productive or hard-working. Common reasons for favoring a cap include a concern about scarcity of resources, a belief that high incomes are disproportionate to contribution, a commitment to equality and the belief that the legitimate needs of high earners are sated. Common reasons for opposing a cap include seeing the idea of a cap as conflicting with a free market system, a belief that high earners deserve their incomes, and a concern that a cap is a restriction on individual freedom. It is suggested that these attitudes should not be understood as arising mainly or only due to the economic recession. The findings show some support for the proposition that economic individualism, which inoculates modestly high incomes from criticism, may be weakened at the extreme.

The original debate with King, Keohane, and Verba--now updated--remains central to the volume, and the new material illuminates evolving discussions of essential methodological tools. Thus, process tracing is often invoked as fundamental to qualitative analysis, but is rarely applied with precision. Pitfalls of regression analysis are sometimes noted, but often are inadequately examined. And the complex assumptions and trade-offs of natural experiments are poorly understood. The second edition extends the methodological horizon through exploring these critical tools. A distinctive feature of this edition is the online placement of four chapters from the prior edition, all focused on the dialogue with King, Keohane, and Verba. Also posted online are exercises for teaching process tracing.},

Findings reveal that employers attach importance to fine-grained indicators of school performance, such as grades and study duration to formulate their hiring decisions, in line with queuing theory. However, internships are disregarded as signals. Results are explained in light of the institutional arrangements that characterize the Italian school-to-work transition system: a standardized education system, poorly specific vocational tracks, weakly developed linkages between schools and firms, a remarkably high dropout rate before study completion.},

This article provides a non-technical overview of the conceptual and methodological issues underlying these conflicting claims. It argues that the dramatically different positions taken in this debate often stem from differences in the concepts and definitions used and differences in data sources and measurement assumptions. These differences are often hidden from view in the debate, but they need to be considered carefully if one is properly to interpret the evidence. The article argues that the best available evidence suggests that, if the rate of progress against absolute poverty in the developing world in the 1990s is maintained, then the Millennium Development Goal of halving the 1990 aggregate poverty rate by 2015 will be achieved on time in the aggregate, though not in all regions.

From this perspective, we examine the balance between survey respondents' evaluation of democratic government and their views of the efficacy of democracy to solve their country's problems, and their joint impact on the molding of citizens' preferences for a particular type of government. Results show that satisfaction with how democratic government performs stands out as one of the reasons underlying individuals' preferences for democracy. Also the belief that democracy does not solve the problems significantly determines the people's choice. Conclusions favor the hypothesis that, in the region, a utilitarian rationality prevails over an axiological rationality (Weber, 1922; Boudon, 1996) in the way citizens form preferences for or against democracy.},

This focus upon justice is contrasted with the more traditional focus upon the level of outcomes received from the political system and upon congruence in citizen-leader policy preferences. The results strongly support a focus upon justice by showing that judgments of injustice exercise an influence upon leadership evaluations and in stitutional endorsements which is independent of beliefs about the level of outcomes the political system is providing to citizens or of public support for government policies. In fact, both studies suggest that judgments of justice or injustice have more influence upon the endorsement of political leaders and institutions than do outcome-related concerns.},

In the analysis the respondents were grouped on value patterns and income position. There was consensus on the main achievement attribute ``occupational prestige'' in assigning fair incomes. There was also some dissension discernible between different groups. However, neither of the theories was fully corroborated.},

Therefore, each respondent gets only a subset of vignettes. These subsets may either be randomly selected in following the tradition of the factorial survey or systematically selected according to an experimental design. We show that these strategies in selecting vignette sets have strong implications for the analysis and interpretation of vignette data. Random selection strategies result in a random confounding of effects and heavily rely on the assumption of no interaction effects. In contrast, experimental strategies systematically confound interaction effects with main or set effects, thereby preserving a meaningful interpretation of main and important interaction effects.

To illustrate the framework, we investigate both a positive-belief equation (describing adolescents' views concerning determination of marital happiness) and a normative-judgment equation (describing judgments of the justice of earnings).

We found that age is negatively associated, and social status positively associated, with reported levels of PPI. Moreover, PPI is higher both when citizens lack intra-familial social solidarity and when they more strongly endorse pro-state welfare attitudes. At the same time, there are distinct culture-specific patterns in PPI, such as the stronger effect of subjective class position and pro-social family norms in Israel. We explain these by reference to the institutional characteristics of the Israeli pension system and the particularly dominant normative position of the family in Israeli-Jewish culture.},

In line with the theoretical literature, we find that both standards are relevant for shaping people's ideas on just earnings. However, there seems to be greater consensus among our respondents on the importance attached to the existential standards than over that attached to the ideal standards. We also found a ``reversed just gender wage gap'': by assigning higher earnings to fictitious female than fictitious male employees, our female and male respondents seem to compensate former gender-related income discrimination against female employees in the German labor market.

Within this context, the normal hypothesis is that responses are consistent on the individual level, but not totally idiosyncratic. In the analysis, it is important to determine the influence of both the vignette and the respondent variables. Analysis models for this type of data should reflect the fact that factorial surveys produce data pertaining to two distinct levels: the individual level and the vignette level. Such models are available and are generally known as multilevel analysis models.

  abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a marked increase in the number of studies on attitude and decision research which use the factorial survey (FS) design. The FS integrates experimental set-ups into a survey: respondents react to hypothetical descriptions (vignettes) while the values of each attribute (dimension) of these descriptions systematically vary in order to estimate their impact on respondent judgments. As the vignettes are based on a number of dimensions and as respondents evaluate several vignettes, FSs are demanding in terms of individual cognitive and information-processing abilities. So far, there is little empirical knowledge of whether and to what extent this complexity is feasible in general population samples with heterogeneous respondents. Using data from a study on the fairness of earnings (with a mixed mode sample consisting a computer assisted personal interview [CAPI], computer assisted self interview [CASI], and paper and pencil [PAPI] mode), the complexity of FSs is analyzed in terms of: 1) design dimensions, such as the number of vignette dimensions (five, eight, or 12) and the number of vignettes for single respondents (10, 20, or 30), which were varied in a 3x3 experimental design; and 2) respondent characteristics that are associated with cognitive abilities (age and education). Two different indicators for cognitive load as well as learning and fatigue effects are analyzed: 1) latency time and 2) response consistency. The results show that raw reaction times but not latency times are longer for older respondents, suggesting that the cognitive effort needed for the evaluation of vignettes is not particularly high. Consistency measures reveal that respondents with a lower educational level show greater inconsistency in their evaluations when the number of vignettes is high. The number of dimensions has an effect on consistency only when respondents have to rate a large number of vignettes. In short, the results demonstrate that FSs are applicable in general population samples but should be used with a limited number of vignettes and dimensions per respondent.},

  abstract = {This research is an empirical study of the legitimacy of economic inequality with a focus on the case of Chile. Chile is an appealing case study in this regard because it has been one of the countries with the highest indexes of economic inequality over the past several decades. Theoretical perspectives based on the rational interest of the median voter have pointed out a negative association between high levels of inequality and legitimacy. Nevertheless, empirical evidence indicates that an unequal distribution of income is not necessarily challenged by the majority of a society, a phenomenon associated with the concept of legitimacy of economic inequality. Most empirical studies of this topic to date have considered social contexts that are not characterized by (comparatively) high levels of income inequality; thus, the impact of the level of inequality on its legitimacy remains largely unclear. The present study aimed at bridging this research gap, guided by the question: How do high levels of income inequality in a society influence the legitimacy of economic inequality? Using data obtained by comparative public opinion projects including the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and the International Social Justice Project (ISJP), this research considered individual preferences for occupational earnings inequality (the just earnings gap) as the main object of study. The central hypothesis was that individual preferences are strongly influenced by contextual standards such as the current income distribution, leading individuals of countries with high levels of inequality to have stronger average preferences for economic inequality (the so-called existential argument). Empirical evidence of legitimacy was related to two central dimensions based on David Beetham's multidimensional concept of legitimacy: (a) consensus regarding the inequality in the distribution of earnings in Chile and (b) the impact of the country level of income inequality on individual preferences for a larger just earnings gap. The empirical analysis provided partial evidence regarding the consensus about inequality in Chile, whereas in an international comparative framework, countries with higher levels of income inequality showed a stronger preference for a larger just earnings gap.},

Our results suggest that these differences have to be explained both in terms of overall country effects and of the influence of country-specific economic interests and socialization experiences.},

Gauntries are then chosen to represent four twin pairs'of countries, approximating four worlds of welfare capitalism': the social democratic (Sweden/Norway), the conservative (Germany/Austria), the liberal (US/Canada), and the radical (Australia/New Zealand). The empirical analysis assesses whether attitudes to redistribution and income differences are structured in the way suggested by the discussion of different cleavage structures in various regime types. It is concluded that while the level of attitudes regarding redistribution and income differences clearly is affected by regime type, group patterns are very similar between all the countries.},

It describes ``postretrenchment politics,'' which constitutes a realignment in the way politics plays out in countries that have undergone social policy retrenchment. In postretrenchment politics, the strengthened position of private business interests, combined with political learning legacies and lock-in effects generated by reforms, results in incremental political change, despite renewed efforts by left parties to address inequality. Global capital also plays an important contextual role, and may influence postretrenchment politics. In postretrenchment politics, newly reformed systems may achieve greater equity, but they do so in fragmented form.},

The article develops a new conceptualization of welfare regimes based on a set of regime-type indicators measured at the country-level and latent variables models. My empirical analysis of support for redistribution across 15 countries suggests that the regime rank order (low to high) with respect to support for redistribution is Liberal, Social Democratic, and Conservative. The regime rank order with respect to the variance in support for redistribution is Liberal, Conservative, and Social Democratic. My findings give rise to a simple two-dimensional typology of regime differences in support for redistribution.},

In the past two decades, Latin American democracies have undergone significant changes in their social welfare institutions, in some cases dramatically reversing course from previous policies. We develop a theoretical framework to explain how and when citizens shift their preferences for competing social policy proposals. We emphasize the role of dissatisfaction with prevailing policies in creating political opportunities for the introduction of sweeping reforms. Our survey capitalizes on the 2008 pension reform in Argentina to test competing hypotheses regarding preferences for different policies of old-age insurance. We find that dissatisfaction with existing private policies increases individual-level support for policy reform across all citizens, whereas partisanship has a more restricted effect, shaping preferences only among middle- and low-income respondents. , Este estudio utiliza una encuesta original y con cobertura nacional en Argentina para determinar los factores pol{\'i}ticos y econ{\'o}micos que influyen en la formaci{\'o}n de las preferencias individuales sobre distintos modelos de seguros sociales.

Since the 1990s, Latin American countries have enacted significant social policy reforms that have supplemented contributory insurance policies with new or expanded non-contributory programmes, financed by general tax revenues. We present a political explanation for this phenomenon, arguing that the process of deindustrialization, and especially the increased labour insecurity that it entails, has changed the mix of social insurance policies favoured by different individuals in the income and employment distributions. A long-term increase in economic insecurity has increased the relative demand for tax-financed, rather than contribution-financed, social insurance. Elected officials, especially those in the recent `rise of the Left' in Latin America, have proved eager to meet these demands. We find strong evidence for this argument using both cross-national data on non-contributory pension policy adoption and individual-level data on policy preferences.},

  abstract = {This article re-assesses classical social theory's relationship with cosmopolitanism. It begins by briefly reconstructing the universalistic thrust that is core to cosmopolitanism and then argues that the rise of classical social theory is marked by the tension of how to retain, but in a renovated form, cosmopolitanism's original universalism. On the one hand, as the heir of the tradition of the Enlightenment, classical social theory remains fully committed to cosmopolitanism's universalism. On the other, however, it needed to rejuvenate that commitment to universalism so that it could work without the normative burden that its traditional natural law elements now represented in the modern context. The article then argues that, in the cases of Karl Marx, Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber, they all started to differentiate the claim to universalism into three different realms: (1) the normative idea of a single modern society that encompasses the whole of humanity; (2) the conceptual definition of what the social element in modern social relations is; and (3) the methodological justification of how to generate adequate empirical knowledge. The conclusion is that, despite differences and shortcomings, it is precisely this claim to universalism that makes classical social theory classical.},

It is often argued that an electoral regime under which voting is voluntary reproduces class bias or, in other words, that the rich vote more than the poor. This bias is corrected either by the introduction of compulsory voting or the existence of strong left-wing parties and trade unions able to mobilize poorer segments of the population. In this article, we put forward an alternative argument. We assert that when voting is voluntary, class bias can disappear if an election is very competitive since this affects both turnout and its socio-economic composition. To evaluate this argument, we examine the case of Chile's 2012 municipal election when voting was voluntary for the first time, instead of compulsory.},

First comparisons of random designs with fractional factorial and D-efficient designs are based on fictitious data, first comparisons with fractional factorial and confounded factorial designs are restricted to theoretical considerations. The aim of this contribution is to compare different designs regarding their reliability and their internal validity. The benchmark for the empirical comparison is established by the estimators from a parsimonious full factorial design, each answered by a sample of 132 students (real instead of fictitious data). Multilevel analyses confirm that, if they exist, balanced confounded factorial designs are ideal. A confounded D-efficient design, as proposed for the first time in this article, is also superior to simple random designs.},

  abstract = {The classic accounts of deliberative democracy are also accounts of legitimacy: 'that outcomes are legitimate to the extent they receive reflective assent through participation in authentic deliberation by all those subject to the decision in question' (Dryzek, 2001, p. 651). And yet, in complex societies deliberative participation by all those affected by collective decision-making is extremely implausible. There are also legitimacy problems with the demanding procedural requirements which deliberation imposes on participants. Given these problems, deliberative democracy seems unable to deliver legitimate outcomes as it defines them. Focusing on the problem of scale, this paper offers a tentative solution using representation, a concept which is itself problematic. Along the way, the paper highlights issues with the legitimate role of experts, the different legitimate uses of statistical and electoral representation, and differences between the research and democratic imperatives driving current attempts to put deliberative principles into practice, illustrated with a case from a Leicester health policy debate. While much work remains to be done on exactly how the principles arrived at might be transformed into working institutions, they do offer a means of criticising existing deliberative practice.},

Use of multiple levels gives rise to an enormous range of statistical benefits. To aid in understanding these benefits, this article provides an elementary introduction to the conceptual basis for multilevel modelling, beginning with classical frequentist, Bayes, and empirical-Bayes techniques as special cases. The article focuses on the role of multilevel averaging ( shrinkage') in the reduction of estimation error, and the role of prior information in finding good averages.},

  title = {Thinking the {{Nation}}: {{Representations}} of {{Nations}} and the {{Pacific Rim}} in {{Latin American}} and {{Asian Textbooks}}},
  volume = {11},
  abstract = {The study of a nation's history in official textbooks is productive for understanding a nation's self-representation and representations of other nations. Hidden beneath the chronology of kings, queens, and wars, is often an implicit narrative, a representation of the way a nation wishes to be seen by its own people, how a nation views other nations, and who represents `the other' within its borders. As the construct of the ``Pacific Rim'' becomes increasingly concretized in governmental actions, economic practices, and cultural activities, we are interested in knowing how various nations in the region depict themselves, other nations, and the region in textbooks. In this article, we consider how the official histories of selected nations portray the Pacific Rim as a region, how Latin American and Asian neighbors portray each other in textbooks, and how Asian and Latin American nations represent nations outside the region. We organized a seminar from January to March 1998 to examine textbook examples from China, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Peru, and Thailand capitalizing on the convergence of scholars at the Center for Iberian and Latin American Studies (CILAS), University of California, San Diego (UCSD), under the auspices of the APEC Study Center, for the conference, ``Cultural Encounters Between Latin America and the Pacific Rim.'' Elementary and secondary textbooks were surveyed. Our overall purpose was to determine what official histories say about a nation, its people, and specifically other Pacific Rim nations. Four themes emerged from our analysis of the textbooks: (1) Historical representations have a decidedly political quality; (2) All but one of the history textbooks we studied has a narrative structure, although different nations emphasize different narratives; (3) Textbook narratives extol the exceptional qualities of the nation; (4) ``The other'' (neighboring nations, other nations within the Pacific Rim region, and indigenous peoples) are not treated evenly in textbooks. The Pacific Rim as a region was discussed indirectly in only Chile's textbooks through a discussion of APEC and in Mexican textbooks in the form of a map of the region. These findings show that textbook narratives continue to focus on `thinking the nation,' even as the concept of the nation is being replaced by regional alliances.},

Mapping: Analiza primero el tema mapas: varios de ellos muestran el wallmapu sin la cordillera de los Andes y abracan enormes superficies del actual territorio chileno. Adem{\'a}s de la producci{\'o}n de mapas, hay todo un movimiento de re-nombrar (Temuko, Pukon, etc). 
2. Painting and writing: El wallmapu no es s{\'o}lo materialidad, sino tambi{\'e}n espiritualidad, y se divide en 4 partes, siendo la habitada por los seres humanos el p{\"u}lli mapu. Mapu debe ser entendido como territorio, con todos los elementos que contiene (r{\'i}os, recursos subterr{\'a}neos) y no s{\'o}lo tierra. Un ejemplo de ello son las pinturas de Eduardo Rapiman, que muestran una tierra que sangra, sufre y explota. Es un protagonista central en la historia de los pueblos ind{\'i}genas.
3. Production of mapuche news: Azkintuwe apareci{\'o} primero en internet y m{\'a}s tarde impreso. Abarca la naci{\'o}n mapuche completa, en puelmapu y gulumapu.},

This article focuses on public opinion and argues that attitudes about international redistribution are not a simple projection of attitudes about the domestic situation. In countries where domestic income redistribution is seen as an important priority, foreign aid is less popular; where this is less so, there is more concern for the fate of the poor in the South. Far from reflecting a lack of coherence in public opinion, these counterintuitive results need to be understood in connection with policy achievements in donor countries. The authors' empirical findings suggest that although the commitment to redistribute is stronger at the national level, relationships of solidarity do not stop at national boundaries. The achievement of justice at home in fact sustains justice abroad.},

The present study tested the predictions that protest groups would have a significantly lower evaluation of authority, be more willing to participate in violence, and have a greater sense of competence than nonprotest groups. Two separate studies were conducted. The first study compared attitudes of an activist protest group, the Young Socialist Alliance, with two nonprotest groups, an active voter registration group and a nonactive student group at the University of Texas. The second study dealt with the attitudes of the campus activist Mexican-American Youth Organization (MAYO) and a Mexican-American non-MAYO group. The following instruments were administered individually and anonymously: a semantic differential to evaluate traditional and legitimate author ities; a participation questionnaire requesting willingness to participate in negotiation, protest, and violent confrontation with authority; a credibility-rating scale to measure the trustworthiness of information issued by authority, and a modified internal-external scale to provide an indirect assessment of competence. The results supported the hypotheses derived from the theory of collective protest.},

In design, these textbooks tend to balance inclusively the best of a nation's history with the text of progress. But when compared in a global context, indigenous history, past and present, works as a counter-text that undercuts the dominant myth of progress, troubling the symbolic coherence of this narrative and the imagined unity of national identity. I seek to articulate an appropriate, in global context, a transnational framework of historical representation, which connects indigenous history with worlds beyond the nation.},

express a moderate evaluative preference for their outgroup but may devaluate it unconsciously. Theoretical accounts of these results are discussed in terms of system justification, conventional stereotypes, and

In agreement with the thesis that methodological nationalism must be rejected and transcended, this article argues that we still lack an understanding of what methodological nationalism actually is and, because of that, we remain unable to answer the substantive problem methodological nationalism poses to social theory: how to understand the history, main features and legacy of the nation-state in modernity. The first section of the article reconstructs the origins of the critique of methodological nationalism in the 1970s and differentiates between its logical and historical versions. It then critically reviews the most salient critique of methodological nationalism in contemporary social theory, that of Ulrich Beck. The final part of the article assesses the thesis of social theory's immanent methodological nationalism by demonstrating how social theory's equivocations towards the nation-state only mirror the nation-state's own ambivalence within modernity. It is shown that social theory's ambivalent attempts at conceptualizing the nation-state reflect the actual ambivalence of the position of the nation-state in modernity: its historical opacity, its sociological uncertainty and its normative ambiguity.},

Distinguishing between stronger and weaker versions of an intersubjective account, it draws attention to Habermas's recent move from a strong intersubjective, constructivist, interpretation of truth to a weaker, non-constructivist, one. It then looks at his refusal to make a similar move in the case of justice, arguing that it is not well-founded, even from the point of view of Habermas's overall concerns. It contends, in particular, that a strong intersubjective conception is not necessary in order to maintain the close link between normative validity and argumentation that plays an important role in Habermas's project of a critical social theory and concludes that the advantages of abandoning a strong intersubjective position outweigh the disadvantages. Consequently, it recommends extension of the weaker, non-constructivist, account that Habermas now proposes in the case of truth to justice as well. In the final section, it considers the implications of this recommendation for Habermas's conception of normative validity in the domain of law and politics.},

A simple model of meritocratic allocation is proposed and applied to provide empirical assessment of "how far to meritocracy?" from empirical reality. The model, conceptualized as an ideal type of meritocracy, incorporates the principle according to which more educated persons do not have lower status than less educated ones. Assuming that a meritocratic society should resemble its ideal type, we have formulated three testable hypotheses involving status mobility within educational groups, status determination by education, and status inequality among educational groups. The tests consist of evaluating the discrepancies between the data on the U.S. total labor force and the model. All three hypotheses implying that American society is close to meritocracy are rejected.},

This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the ``meritocratic power'' of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor's degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor's degree alone.},

The framework is grounded in two foundational propositions: (1) Many forms of human suffering and many deficits in human flourishing are the result of existing institutions and social structures. (2) Transforming existing institutions and social structures in the right way has the potential to substantially reduce human suffering and expand the possibilities for human flourishing. An emancipatory social science responding to these propositions faces four broad tasks: specifying the moral principles for judging social institutions; using these moral principles as the standards for diagnosis and critique of existing institutions; developing an account of viable alternatives in response to the critique; and proposing a theory of transformation for realizing those alternatives. The idea of ``real utopias'' is one way of thinking about alternatives and transformation.},

  volume = {52},
  issn = {0049-089X},
  abstract = {In the wake of rising levels of income inequality during the past two decades, widespread concerns emerged about the social and political consequences of the widening gap between the poor and the rich that can be observed in many established democracies. Several empirical studies substantiate the link between macro-level income inequality and political attitudes and behavior, pointing at its broad and negative implications for political equality. Accordingly, these implications are expected to be accentuated in contexts of high inequality, as is the case in Latin America. Despite these general concerns about the consequences of income inequality, few studies have accounted for the importance of individual perceptions of distributive fairness in regard to trust in political institutions. Even less is known about the extent to which distributive fairness perceptions co-vary with objective indicators of inequality. Moreover, the research in this area has traditionally focused on OECD countries, which have lower indexes of inequality than the rest of the world. This study aims at filling this gap by focusing on the relevance of distributive fairness perceptions and macro-level inequality for political trust and on how these two levels interact in Latin American countries. The analyses are based on the Latinobarometer survey 2011, which consists of 18 countries. Multilevel estimations suggest that both dimensions of inequality are negatively associated with political trust but that higher levels of macro-level inequality attenuate rather than increase the strength of the negative association between distributive fairness perceptions and political trust.},

We draw on literatures in political science, sociology and science and technology studies to explain this apparent contradiction. Existing research suggests that the influence of economics is mediated by local circumstances and meso-level social structures, and that much of it flows through indirect channels. We elaborate three sites of analysis useful for unpacking these influences: the broad professional authority of economics, the institutional position of economists in government, and the role of economics in the cognitive infrastructure of policymaking, including the diffusion of economic styles of reasoning and the establishment of economic policy devices for seeing and deciding.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a framework for understanding the ways in which social processes produce social inequality. Specifically, we focus on a particular type of social process that has received limited attention in the literature and in which inter-subjective meaning-making is central: cultural processes. Much of the literature on inequality has focused on the actions of dominant actors and institutions in gaining access to material and non-material resources, or on how ecological effects cause unequal access to material resources. In contrast, we focus on processes that contribute to the production (and reproduction) of inequality through the routine and taken-for-granted actions of both dominant and subordinate actors. We highlight two types of cultural processes: identification and rationalization. We describe and illustrate four processes that we consider to be significant analytical exemplars of these two types of cultural processes: racialization and stigmatization (for identification) and standardization and evaluation (for rationalization). We argue that attention to such cultural processes is critical and complementary to current explanations of social inequality.},

  abstract = {Korpi and Palme's (1998) classic ``The Paradox of Redistribution and Strategies of Equality'' claims that universal social policy better reduces poverty than social policies targeted at the poor. This article revisits Korpi and Palme's classic, and in the process, explores and informs a set of enduring questions about social policy, politics, and social equality. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between three dimensions of welfare transfers\textemdash{}transfer share (the average share of household income from welfare transfers), low-income targeting, and universalism\textemdash{}and poverty and preferences for redistribution. We analyze rich democracies like Korpi and Palme, but we also generalize to a broader sample of developed and developing countries. Consistent with Korpi and Palme, we show (1) poverty is negatively associated with transfer share and universalism; (2) redistribution preferences are negatively associated with low-income targeting; and (3) universalism is positively associated with transfer share. Contrary to Korpi and Palme, redistribution preferences are not related to transfer share or universalism; and low-income targeting is neither positively associated with poverty nor negatively associated with transfer share. Therefore, instead of the ``paradox of redistribution'' we propose two new paradoxes of social policy: non-complementarity and undermining. The non-complementarity paradox entails a mismatch between the dimensions that matter to poverty and the dimension that matters to redistribution preferences. The undermining paradox emphasizes that the dimension (transfer share) that most reduces poverty tends to increase with the one dimension (low-income targeting) that reduces support for redistribution.},

It attempts to cover studies from all regions of the world, despite the concentration of current research on developed countries. The main conclusion is that factors not related to productivity are a key determinant of affluence and that this has not changed much over the last century.},

At the individual level, education strengthens support for education-based meritocracy but has less impact on perceptions of meritocracy. National indicators are also associated with perceived and preferred meritocracy. Perceived meritocracy is correlated with the expansion of the education system, while the support for education-based meritocracy is correlated with average returns to education. We also find that perceptions and preferences may be affected by such national characteristics as inequality and the average wealth.},

Few studies, however, have examined whether people believe they live in a meritocratic society. In this paper, we use the 1987 and 2010 General Social Survey to examine people's perceptions of meritocracy in the U.S. Although most Americans agree that getting ahead depends on meritocratic elements like hard work, their beliefs vary in strength. They disagree even more about the importance of non-meritocratic elements such as family wealth, and race. Furthermore, Americans layer these beliefs on top of each other to create a variety of perspectives on meritocracy. Young, upper class Whites are most likely to see the U.S. as a place where meritocratic elements rule. Older, lower class minorities, in contrast, are most likely to believe that non-meritocratic elements dominate. There are also Americans who believe strongly in both types of elements and those who do not believe strongly in either.},

  abstract = {Survey experiments are a core tool for causal inference. Yet, the design of classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how conjoint analysis, an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.},

Conversely, for individuals that do not legitimize inequality, a weaker relation between these variables will be observed. We tested these ideas in two studies. In Study 1, we measured perceived and ideal inequalities (i.e., pay gap) and individual differences in the legitimization of inequality. In Study 2, we measured perceived and ideal inequalities using a novel abacus procedure in which participants had to allocate resources to the different income quintiles, and we then manipulated the legitimacy (vs. illegitimacy) of economic inequality. According to our hypothesis, in both studies we found that when individuals legitimize inequality (vs. when they do not), the relation between perceived and ideal economic inequalities tends to be stronger.},

This article discusses key factors that affect U.S. economic growth, including the number of workers, their skill level, and the level of innovation and investment in new ideas. There are limited prospects for growth in the number of workers, due to changes in age distribution, immigration, and women's labor force participation. There has been a slow increase in worker skills in the United States, and there are opportunities for further growth in educational attainment. The role of innovation in developing new products and services that improve our wellbeing and drive productivity growth is a key driver of long-term growth, which means that the United States needs to stay at the front edge of basic and translational research. In recent decades, the preeminent U.S. position in the world economy has eroded as other countries have outstripped the United States in the growth of their educated workforce. At the same time, other countries have greatly increased their investments in basic research and innovation while U.S. investments have stalled. If the United States is to retain its long-term economic leadership, it must pay attention to policies that will enhance skills and innovation.

Using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), it is possible to provide evidence on this question, evidence that is suggestive but must be carefully interpreted because the samples are relatively small. The GSS data reveal an increase in class reproduction among young and middle-age adults that is driven by the growing advantage of the professional-managerial class relative to all other classes. This trend is largely consistent with our new ``top-income hypothesis'' that posits that rising income inequality registers its effects on social mobility almost exclusively in the divide between the professional-managerial class and all other classes. We develop a two-factor model in which the foregoing effects of the inequality takeoff are set against the countervailing effects of the expansion of mass education. As the model implies, the trend in intergenerational association takes on a convex shape in the younger age groups, with the change appearing to accelerate in the most recent decade. These results suggest that the takeoff in income inequality may account in part for the decline in mobility.},

New analyses of the General Social Surveys from 1974 to 2012 address questions in the literature regarding aggregate responses to hard times, whether the income-class relationship is linear or not, and whether inequality affects happiness. General happiness dropped significantly during the Great Recession, suggesting that the income-happiness relationship might also exist at the macro level. People with extremely low incomes are not as unhappy as a linear model expects, but there is no evidence of a threshold beyond which personal happiness stops increasing. Comparing happiness over the long term, the affluent were about as happy in 2012 as they were in the 1970s, but the poor were much less happy. Consequently, the gross happiness gap by income was about 30 percent bigger in 2012 than it was in the 1970s. A multivariate model shows that the net effect of income on happiness also increased significantly over time.},

We frame our research within the recent literature on the ``polarization'' of the electorate with respect to social and cultural issues. Using Hunter's ``culture war'' imagery, we examine the extent to which opposing cultural forces on issues of abortion, gay rights, women's extra-familial labor force participation, and child-rearing have become more important in shaping political identities and party preferences. We use data from twenty-six nationally representative surveys of the General Social Survey (GSS) from 1974 through 2010, and we find evidence of polarization in the liberal-conservative identities of respondents. We find that occupational class had a clear and consistent relationship to political views, which is relatively stable over time. We also find that cultural views are related to political identities, and that most features of the cultural component in our analysis are increasingly associated with liberal political views. Our results favor an interpretation of a changing role of cultural orientations in shaping political identities and provide tentative support for Frank's ``Kansas hypothesis'' as revealed in the GSS data.},

  issn = {0001-6993, 1502-3869},
  abstract = {The acceptance of income differences varies across countries. This article suggests belief in three narratives of modernity to account for this: the ``tunnel effect,'' related to perceptions of generational mobility; the ``procedural justice effect,'' related to the perceived fairness in the process of getting ahead; and the ``middle-class effect,'' related to perceptions of the social structure of society. The importance of the suggested narratives is tested by means of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2009 module, which includes 38 countries. The finding is that belief in the three narratives can account for a considerable part of the cross-national variation. Beliefs in procedural justice and the existence of a middle-class society clearly go together with high acceptance of current income differences, while the ``tunnel effect'' is more complex. In general, belief in generational mobility goes together with acceptance of current income differences. But personal experience of such upward social mobility actually lowers acceptance of current income differences, especially if overall generational mobility in society is believed to be backward. The framework explains most country-cases, which points to the existence of general patterns. But the models also indicate that the Philippines, and to a lesser extent the US and France, are special cases.},

  abstract = {"All researchers want to produce interesting and influential theories. A key step in all theory development is formulating innovative research questions that will result in interesting and significant research. Traditional textbooks on research methods tend to ignore, or gloss over, actual ways of constructing research questions. In this text, Alvesson and Sandberg develop a problematization methodology for identifying and challenging the assumptions underlying existing theories and for generating research questions that can lead to more interesting and influential theories, using examples from across the social sciences. Established methods of generating research questions in the social sciences tend to focus on 'gap-spotting', which means that existing literature remains largely unchallenged. The authors show the dangers of conventional approaches, providing detailed ideas for how one can work through such problems and formulate novel research questions that challenge existing theories and produce more imaginative empirical studies. Constructing Research Questions is essential reading for any researcher looking to formulate research questions that are interesting and novel."--Publisher's website},

  abstract = {Meritocratic attitudes are defined as general beliefs that education and its correlates should determine personal economic outcomes. Using the International Social Survey Project (ISSP): Social Inequality Module (1992), we examine both individual-level and country-level determinants of pro-meritocratic attitudes. According to self-interest and rational-action theories, individuals with high educational attainment and high personal income are expected to have strong meritocratic beliefs because meritocracy is in their best interest\textemdash{}they would gain under such a system. At the same time, both modernization and post-industrial theories imply that persons living in countries with a high degree of societal meritocracy hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than persons living in countries with low degree of societal meritocracy. Results of the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis on a data set including 7,972 persons from 14 countries indicate that the impact of individuals' education and income on meritocratic attitudes occurred as theoretically predicted. We also demonstrate that the relationship between the degree of societal meritocracy and the degree of support for such a system is statistically significant even if national wealth and educational stock (as well as individual-level variables) are controlled. In addition, we discovered that at the beginning of the 1990s a post-communist regime had a negative effect on support for meritocracy.},

Although some research indirectly suggests that believing that meritocracy exists may increase wellbeing, group consciousness theories suggest that disbelieving that meritocracy exists will enhance psychological adjustment to gender discrimination. Women who reported little past experience with discrimination, and either believed or disbelieved that meritocracy exists, were exposed to either a laboratory situation of discrimination or a nondiscrimination failure (control) condition. Consistent with group consciousness theories, women experiencing discrimination reported greater well-being if they disbelieved that meritocracy exists than if they were believers. In contrast, women in the control condition reported greater wellbeing if they believed that meritocracy exists than if they were disbelievers. Implications for coping with discrimination are discussed.},

The case of a public debate about the record salary of the car manufacturer VW's CEO, Martin Winterkorn, in 2012 and 2013, is identified as a rich source for a reconstruction of specific argumentative patterns and their underlying premises. The typology presents five justification patterns, (1) equality of opportunity, (2) desert, (3) procedure of salary determination, (4) harmful consequences of income inequality and (5) need. Further cross-patterns are identified. A key finding is the crucial\textemdash{}but often not explicit\textemdash{}role of factual, definitional or behavioural premises.

Not only would he have rejected neoliberalism's "one model fits all" approach to development, he could hardly have embraced an approach that privileges efficiency and the creation of wealth over its distribution; he was far too concerned with the "providential fact" of social equality and its implications for democracy. For Tocqueville, the "general equality of condition" that so struck him during his stay in the United States (I, 3) was the basic building block for political democracy; any change toward overly skewed social and economic inequalities would, in his view, inevitably endanger democratic politics. In contrast with many contemporary institutions and scholars, he would not have failed to take account of how economic policy prescriptions affect equality or to recognize their impact on the sustainability and quality of new democracies. Yet Tocqueville's writings are no simple paean to egalitarianism or majority rule. An aristocrat himself, he was nonetheless critical of the old order, yet he was no blind fan of the new. Profoundly ambivalent about a relationship between democracy and equality that threatened to produce a "tyranny of the majority," he also warned that...

  abstract = {Modernization theorists from Karl Marx to Daniel Bell have argued that economic development brings pervasive cultural changes. But others, from Max Weber to Samuel Huntington, have claimed that cultural values are an enduring and autonomous influence on society. We test the thesis that economic development is linked with systematic changes in basic values. Using data from the three waves of the World Values Surveys, which include 65 societies and 75 percent of the world's population, we find evidence of both massive cultural change and the persistence of distinctive cultural traditions. Economic development is associated with shifts away from absolute norms and values toward values that are increasingly rational, tolerant, trusting, and participatory. Cultural change, however, is path dependent. The broad cultural heritage of a society-Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Confucian, or Communist-leaves an imprint on values that endures despite modernization. Moreover, the differences between the values held by members of different religions within given societies are much smaller than are cross-national differences. Once established, such cross-cultural differences become part of a national culture transmitted by educational institutions and mass media. We conclude with some proposed revisions of modernization theory.},

The empirical literature has concentrated on cross-country studies and the size of the public sector, and the results broadly do not indicate more redistribution with more inequality. This analysis suggests that the hypothesis should be investigated in a more homogenous setting with comparable institutions and with an explicit decision about redistribution (here tax structure). New data on poll tax and property tax in decentralized government in Norway are exploited. We show how the multi-dimensional decision can be analyzed as majority rule assuming intermediate preferences. In the econometric analysis, instruments are used to account for endogeneity of income level and income distribution. The estimated model supports the understanding that more unequal income distribution implies a shift in the tax burden from poll tax to property taxes and thereby gives more redistribution.},

This is shown most clearly in the use of perfect mobility as the theoretical model that underlies most of the empirical analyses. A major consequence is that these analyses have offered a poor conceptualisation of the nature of the structure within which movement occurs, and have tended to ignore the question of relative distances between the objects, typically conceived as social classes, making up that structure. A further consequence is that they have concentrated on the issue of how much mobility, rather than on why it does, or does not, occur. It is argued that a more adequate conceptualisation would involve a move away from rigidly defined class categories towards a recognition of the hierarchical structure of occupational groups.},

This limits the ability to address a question that seems to be at the heart of developmental failures: Why do societies fail to adopt the institutional structure of more economically successful ones? This paper integrates game-theoretical and sociological concepts to conduct a comparative historical analysis of the relations between culture and institutional structure. It examines cultural factors that have led two premodern societies--one from the Muslim world and the other from the Latin world--to evolve along distinct trajectories of institutional structure. It indicates the theoretical importance of culture in determining institutional structures, in leading to their path dependence, and in forestalling successful intersociety adoption of institutions. Since the distinct institutional structures found in the late medieval period resemble those differentiating contemporary developing and developed economies, the paper suggests the historical importance of distinct cultures in economic development.},

Several authors have argued that (i) higher inequality causes higher demand for redistribution, (ii) which leads to greater redistribution and higher taxes, and (iii) which is in turn harmful to growth. This article addresses the first step of this argument, a proposition that has been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Using cross section data for 26 countries from the ISSP's module on Social Inequality, it presents an empirical test that yields no support for the idea that public support for redistribution rises with inequality across countries. This finding is attributed to the influence of social justice norms that vary greatly between groups of culturally similar countries.},

Governments produce social order (or protection) as a territorially bounded public utility, which is seen as a productive force. Citizens invest a social order with differing degrees of legitimacy which is thus, via motivation, an important competitive resource. A multiple regression design covering 18 Western core societies over the postwar era is used to test whether legitimacy, operationalized as relative absence of mass political protest, has an effect on comparative overall economic performance once initial wealth, absolute and relative size of government and membership in trading blocs are controlled for. We find robust empirical evidence for a positive impact of legitimacy on growth in the postwar era. The study thus suggests additional support for the theory of the world market for protection', developed elsewhere to explain long-term economic success and societal convergence at the core of the world system.},

Two kinds of international economic dependence are studied: investment dependence, the penetration of a country by foreign capital and debt dependence, the dependence of a government on foreign credit. The dependent variables studied include three measures of aggregate economic development: gross national product per capita, kilowatt hours of electricity consumed and the percentage of the male labor force not employed in agriculture. In addition, two control variables are included in the analysis: domestic capital formation and the extent to which the national economy is specialized in mining. The research design employed is panel regression analysis, which utilizes data at two points in time (1950 and 1970). The results indicate that both types of international economic dependence have overall negative effects on aggregate economic development. A cross-sectional estimate of the dependence effects on income inequality produces positive, though not statistically significant effects. It is concluded that dependency theories predict the effects of inputs from advanced nations to less-developed ones better than neo-classical international economic theories or sociological modernization theories.},

Results from college students in the United States and Germany revealed the following. First, reactions to allocators form two clusters: intelligent/strong/logical and warm/nice. Second, when giving a positive resource, American allocators are in a real dilemma: If they give on the basis of merit, they are rated high on the first cluster but low on the second; if they favor the needy, reactions reverse. No such dilemma exists for German allocators or in negative allocation situations where everyone approves of a need allocation. Third, Americans evaluate equality allocators quite highly, especially in the negative allocation condition. Fourth, allocators who have bonuses to distribute are evaluated more positively-another example of the fundamental attribution error.},

Valued status positions are a reward for those whose distribution members develop expectations. The more differentiated these expectations, the more likely that the power and prestige order will be treated as legitimate. Applying our formulation to various types of group structures we derive a set of theoretical assertions that relate the initial status composition of a group to the likelihood that its power and prestige order becomes legitimatized. These predict, among other things, that legitimation of structure is more likely to develop in heterogeneous status consistent groups than in groups that are initially homogeneous, and it is more likely to develop in the latter groups than in heterogeneous status inconsistent groups. If verified, these predictions will provide an explanation for the difficulty that those who operate from a disadvantaged external status position, such as women and minorities in mixed sex or bi-racial groups, often face in trying to wield directive power over their members even when they are task leaders.},

A sample of 11 articles taken from the relatively liberal news magazine Newsweek is compared with conservative ideology concerning welfare and poverty to illustrate this argument. This transformation of the welfare debate is placed in the broader context of a changing political climate and dominant ideology, in which the socially inclusive `Keynesianism' (or corporate-liberalism) has been increasingly replaced by the neo-liberal ideology of unfettered market forces. The conservative argument concerning poverty which stresses cultural factors and induces victim-blaming is part and parcel of the neo-liberal discourse of individualism and laissez-faire economics.},

It is argued in this article that the widely used but also widely criticized Gini index can be seen to incorporate a particularly sociological conception of inequality. The Gini index has features that are alien to mainstream welfare economics, but perfectly sensible if inequality is understood more sociologically as arising from a state of relative deprivation. However, the commitment to a relativistic conception of inequality leads to serious theoretical and practical complications. The implicit rationale of the Gini index assumes that it is applied to a reference population' - where everybody compares themselves with everybody else. It is not obvious that the residents of a nation-state always constitute a reference population in this sense, and arguments can be found both for widening and narrowing the scope of the relevant population. Both aggregation and disaggregation from whatever is considered to be the appropriate' scope of the reference population is problematic and requires different methodological solutions.},

  volume = {22},

Several limitations in the existing literature regarding the dependent variable, the operationalisation of welfare regimes, how the relationship between regimes and attitudes is identified, and the methods used are proposed as reasons why no link between regimes and attitudes has been found. An alternative approach is developed in which welfare regimes are operationalised using a range of theoretically defining characteristics, e.g. total public social spending, benefit generosity, and the weight of social services relative to total public social expenditure. Using data on 13 Western European countries from the first two waves of the European Social Survey, the empirical analysis provides mixed support for the hypothesized relationship between welfare regimes and support for redistribution. Several suggestions for future research are also discussed.},

  abstract = {In various earlier studies focusing on support for the welfare state, attitudinal differences have been explained by factors linked to individual social characteristics of respondents. This study focuses mainly on how macro-sociological variables influence attitudes towards the public service system in Finland. An attempt is made to investigate whether differences between municipalities in public-policy measures, political climate and the economic situation have effects on ordinary citizens' support for the service system or whether such support is only related to the individual-level factors, such as socio-economic position and gender, that are traditionally used in studies of attitudes. A focus on attitudes towards economy measures makes it possible simultaneously to investigate the kinds of municipal-level circumstances that affect the acceptance of a retrenchment of the 'service state'. The analyses are based on individual-level data (n = 1,024) and municipal-level Finnish data. The results show that different indicators of macro-sociological factors do have an impact on people's attitudes towards public services. Individuals in municipalities where economic conditions are relatively poor, where the level of social and health expenditure is low and, on some issues, where bourgeois parties are the dominating political bloc, show a lower level of support for the welfare services. However, the impact of tax policies is not that significant on any of the questions studied. The interpretation of the results includes a discussion of specific problems associated with this type of analysis.},

After exploring different forms of violence and discussing the impoverishment which affects the region, the authors suggest that the spread of violence and crime is influenced by forces of global and local transformation which cause that violence to transcend national boundaries while reflecting the particular characteristics of each locality's culture and social organization. Through an analysis of five related processes: (1) changes in the drug economy; (2) proliferation of firearms; (3) similarity of cultural patterns of violence; (4) generalized fear among the population; and (5) citizen support for retaliation and extralegal violence (the latter in dangerous rapid expansion), the authors conclude by asserting that the appropriation of violence and its implacable logic of escalation can only lead to reciprocal annihilation. The strengthening of the state and the restoration of the rule of law comprise the necessary alternative for defending people's integrity and regaining freedom in the city.},

Next, the study uses a larger set of nations and finds a signigicant increase in world income inequality as measured by both Gini and Theil coefficients, particularly during the 1980s. The findings are robust even after controlling for differential rates of population growth or using alternative sources of data.

The authors propose structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the universality of psychological processes at the individual and culture levels. Specifically, the structural equivalence of the measurement (where the instrument is measuring the same construct across countries) is first tested with meta-analytic SEM. If the measurement is structurally equivalent, cross-level equivalence (where the instrument is measuring similar constructs at different levels) will then be tested with multilevel SEM. A large data set on social axioms with 7,590 university students from 40 cultural groups was used to illustrate the procedures. The results showed that the structural equivalence of the social axioms was well supported at the individual level across 40 cultural groups, whereas the cross-level equivalence was partially supported. The superiority of the SEM approach and the theoretical meaning of its solution are discussed.},

In their turn, these constructs were expected to have negative and positive influences upon intervention.

It outlines a comprehensive guide to the terms and factors where culture may manifest itself and proposes a protocol for discerning the operation of culture. Methodological issues related to the conceptualization and operationalization of justice processes are addressed throughout. The first section develops a framework for justice analysis, distinguishing between ingredients thought to be universal and ingredients in which culture may operate. The second section discusses deductive theories in justice analysis and provides an illustration, in which one of the theories yields implications for individualism and collectivism, thus showing how justice processes can generate phenomena that come to be viewed as culturally based. The concluding section briefly discusses agendas and research designs for empirical analysis of justice and culture.},

I address this question by investigating the effects of capital and trade flows on government welfare spending in fifty-three developing countries. Using an original measure of labor power in developing countries, I test the links between international markets, labor's political strength, and the welfare state. I argue that labor's collective-action problems, caused by large populations of low-skilled and surplus workers, offset labor's potential political gains from globalization. I show that when the proportion of low-skilled workers in a nation is high, globalization will lead to a decline in welfare spending. Most significantly, the results suggest that in nations where labor-market institutions are not yet well developed, government social-welfare spending is constrained by international market. forces},

These, in turn, furnish legal domination with its aura of administrative rationality and adequacy. The formal analytic features of bureaucratic discipline are drawn from Weber's studies of the army, church, university, and political party, as well as from the organization of the discovering social sciences. Foucault's studies of the hospital, prison, and school, in addition to accounts of the factory system by Marx and recent social historians, ground Weberian formal analysis in the history of various social techniques for the administration of corporeal, attitidunal and behavioural discipline, i.e., the disciplinary society. Foucault's studies, however controversial, may be seen to extend Weber's concept of rational-legal discipline through studies of the discursive practices that construct a physiology of power/knowledge which deserves the attention of social scientists.},

  abstract = {ncome inequality Health inequalities Political economy of health Class and health There has been a recent upsurge of interest in the relationship between income inequality and health within nations and between nations. On the latter topic Wilkinson and others believe that, in the advanced capitalist countries, higher income inequality leads to lowered social cohesion which in turn produces poorer health status. I argue that, despite a by-now voluminous literature, not enough attention has been paid to the social context of income inequality -- health relationships or to the causes of income inequality itself. In this paper I contend that there is a particular affinity between neo-liberal (market-oriented) political doctrines, income inequality and lowered social cohesion. Neo-liberalism, it is argued, produces both higher income inequality and lowered social cohesion. Part of the negative effect of neo-liberalism on health status is due to its undermining of the welfare state. The welfare state may have direct effects on health as well as being one of the underlying structural causes of social cohesion. The rise of neo-liberalism and the decline of the welfare state are themselves tied to globalization and the changing class structures of the advanced capitalist societies. More attention should be paid to understanding the causes of income inequalities and not just to its effects because income inequalities are neither necessary nor inevitable. Moreover, understanding the contextual causes of inequality may also influence our notion of the causal pathways involved in inequality-health status relationships (and vice versa).},

The main prediction was that high and low identifiers will respond differentially when their group's status or distinctiveness is threatened such that self-stereotyping is reduced for low identifiers but enhanced for high identifiers. Although the four studies investigated different comparison groups and different kinds of group threat, the results of all studies provided support for the prediction, and this was confirmed by a meta-analysis. This supports the authors' argument that the initial level of group identification determines whether group members are likely to set themselves apart from the rest of their group or to show group solidarity when their identity as group members is threatened.},

  volume = {17},
  abstract = {Comparisons are central to sociology and prominent among them are comparisons between the way two variables are related in different contexts (e.g. the present compared to the past, blacks compared to whites, industrial societies compared to agrarian ones). It is crucial, therefore, that analytic techniques used to test for such differences accurately reflect the true situation. A variety of statistical approaches have been used, most notably, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with dummy variables and interaction terms. Recently, however, Goodman's log-linear procedure has been advocated as a `better' way of dealing with certain types of comparisons and particular models have been widely used. However, there is some question as to their applicability in answering theoretical questions typically posed in comparative sociological research. In this paper, we address this issue. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we set up a typical but hypothetical set of data that would be appropriate for testing comparative theories of socioeconomic achievement or intergenerational mobility. This allows us to examine the ramifications of choosing particular analytic techniques on the conclusions drawn about theoretical propositions. Following conventions established in the literature, we apply two analytic techniques to the same set of data under a variety of conditions. Specifically, we compare the use of widely applied OLS regression and log-linear models where we set (1) the slope differences and (2) the mean differences in the variables between the contexts to vary. The simulation suggests that the regression procedure is able to pick up differences which would be of theoretical interest to the sociologist while the log-linear procedure, given the particular situation modelled here, does not. This is more likely to occur in those cases where the contexts compared have very different distributions. This does not reflect any problems in the log-linear technique itself. Ordered models are more likely to detect these differences because they are parsimonious with respect to degrees of freedom. However, this is not the only factor, methodological or theoretical, that needs to be considered in the choice of techniques. In particular, the findings alert us to difficulties inherent in testing sociological theories where (1) operationalizations of important concepts can result in very different measures and (2) conventional applications of these techniques fail to provide a valid test of proposed theoretical questions. Focussing on factors which may account for the differences observed, we address issues in the existing debate over the use of log-linear and regression models. We discuss the theoretical questions in stratification research for which log-linear techniques can be a useful tool and those for which it is misleading. Finally, we outline the theoretical and methodological tradeoffs in using each technique and suggest another not commonly employed in sociological research.},

The article concludes with an assessment of the capacity of this emerging political agenda and attendant "polycentric development coalitions" to deepen and extend democracy effectively beyond the electoral arena to include basic issues of justice and equity.},

They are John Goldthorpe's analysis of social mobility from a class formation perspective and Erik O Wright's analysis of income inequality in the labor market. I argue that the main problem with both efforts is the lack of a satisfactory theory of how class generates inequality within the labor market. The logic of Gold thorpe's argument assumes that class causes inequality generating separate class interests in the labor market, but he does not provide such a theory. Wnght provides such a theory. However, his several class schemes either provide explanations for inequality that can be derived from standard internal labor market theory that does not satisfy the requirement of class theory; or, they are based on a concept of exploitation that is unsatisfactory for the identification of class categories within the labor market. I observe that it is not clear why Marxist theory needs a class theory of how inequality is generated within the labor market: standard neo-classical economic theory seems consistent with Marx's own conception of the capitalist economy},

The analysis of survey data indicates that there is no evidence for the view that attitudes to welfare provision add up to a consistent disaffection with policy. Perceptions of self-interest emerge as the best predictors of preferences, and these appear closely related to location in a typical family life-style.},

Power did not have an independent effect on bias; rather, members of both high and low power groups showed more bias when the power hierarchy was illegitimate than when it was legitimate. This effect was replicated in Experiment 2 (N = 105). In addition, Experiment 2 showed that groups located within an unfair power hierarchy expected the superordinate power body to be more discriminatory than did those who had legitimately high or low power.

This last theory is predominantly institutional, unlike the emphasis upon religious ideas and motivations in his early Protestant Ethic thesis, and unlike his analyses of the world religions. Weber's institutional theory involves a sequence of causal conditions. The outcome of the sequence is capitalism characterized by the entrepreneurial organization of capital, rationalized technology, free labor, and unrestrained markets. Intermediate conditions are a calculable legal system and an economic ethic combining universal commercialization with the moderate pursuit of repetitive gains. These conditions are fostered by the bureaucratic state and by legal citizenship, and more remotely by a complex of administrative, military, and religious factors. The overall pattern is one in which numerous elements must be balanced in continuous conflict if economic development is to take place. Weber derived much of this scheme in explicit confrontation with Marxism. His conflict theory criticizes as well as deepens and extends a number of Marxian themes, including a theory of international capitalism which both criticizes and complements Wallerstein's theory of the world system.},

The article discusses methodological shortcomings and potential solutions in selecting cases. All comparative research of social entities, whether quantitative or qualitative, faces the problem of contingency, the fact that the potential pool of cases has been pre-selected by historical and political processes. In large-N cross-national studies the use of inference statistics is problematic since random selection is rarely given and the cases represent a highly stratified set. In small-N case studies, however, the selection of cases is a deliberate choice based on the theory-driven comparative method. The epistemological and methodological problems of both comparative approaches are discussed and evaluated.},

Can these findings be replicated in natural settings? This study compared the attributions made in two domains (sports articles and editorials) of newspapers published in two culturally distinct countries (Hong Kong and the United States). Consistent with the cross-cultural research, attributions were less dispositional in the East than in the West. This cultural difference was weaker in editorials than in sports articles. The authors argue that the higher level of complexity, accountability, and uncertainty in editorials increased the cognitive effort expended to make attributions, which, in turn, attenuated their extremity. Implications for the mixed model of social inference are discussed.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {This article examines American education in comparative perspective, suggesting that the distinctive structure of the school system is both an embodiment and a source of the felt fluidity of class boundaries in the United States. Several characteristic features of the American educational system are identified: the avoidance of early selection, the lack of sharp segmentation between different types of institutions, relative freedom of movement both among and within institutions, openness to new fields of study, high levels of enrollment, and the provision of opportunities for educational mobility well into adulthood. The two-year public community college, it argues, is an essential expression of these patterns which, through its very accessibility, reinforces the American ideology that it is never too late for individual talent to reveal itself - and to be rewarded. The article concludes with a discussion of the effects of the nation's distinctive school system on American culture and politics, suggesting that the perceived ldquoclasslessnessrdquo of American society may in part be a product of its seemingly open and democratic structure of education.

  title = {Studying {{Status}}: {{An Integrated Framework}}},
  volume = {66},
  abstract = {This paper reports development of an integrated framework for studying status. The framework provides models and methods for addressing long-standing, unresolved issues, such as (1) the emergence of status, (2) distinguishing between the status of individuals and the status of characteristics, and (3) measuring and understanding the status gap between subgroups (between men and women, or between races). The framework, which covers both small groups and large societies, and both task and nontask groups, utilizes ideas and insights from several literatures to identify three types of status, linked in precise ways to two kinds of personal characteristics (quantitative and qualitative). The three types of status are mathematically specified, and initial theoretical development is presented for all three, including, for each, formulation of measures, derivation of testable implications, and analysis of how to change status and the status structure. Testable implications cover such phenomena as status differences between group members, status gaps between subgroups, over-all status inequality, and status gains and losses from discrimination - all under varying conditions, including the number and intercorrelation of status-conferring personal characteristics and the proportions in the subgroups. The new status theory also identifies two mechanisms involved in the phenomenon of "internalized oppression." The framework thus opens many avenues for future work, both theoretical work, deriving more and sharper implications, and empirical work, testing the implications and using the new measures for the status of persons and the status of characteristics to assess key status phenomena in surveys and experiments.

Eight major sources of legitimacy are distinguished, namely, convention, contract, universal principles, sacredness, expertise, popular approval, personal ties and personal qualities. This classification is then used as the basis for a critique of Weber's typology of forms of domination. It is argued that Weber's threefold classification of claims to legitimacy which formed the basis of his classification of types of domination actually comprises five separate principles of legitimation, namely, convention, sacredness, personal ties, personal qualities and rationality. Weber's threefold classification of forms of domination is not mistaken on this account however, since the three sets of principles which Weber's classification of forms of legitimacy comprise occur in conjunction with three specific types of command-obedience relationship. Contrary to Weber's argument however, the structure of domination in the cases of traditional and legal authority is not derived from the mode of claiming legitimacy, rather, the reverse is true.},

Simultaneous equations decompose the relationship between X and Y into an indirect component, operating through Z, and a direct component, the relationship between X and Y given Z. Often, X, Y, and/or Z are measured with error. Structural equation modeling is widely used in this scenario. However, sociological data commonly have a nested structure (students within schools, residents within local areas). Hierarchical linear models represent such multilevel data well and can handle errors of measurement, but have not incorporated simultaneous equations for direct and indirect effects. This article incorporates the study of such mediated effects into the hierarchical linear model, naturally extending the analysis to include unbalanced, multilevel designs and missing data. The authors illustrate the approach by examining the extent to which neighborhood social control mediates the relationship between neighborhood social composition and violence in Chicago.},

Simultaneous equations decompose the relationship between X and Y into an indirect component, operating through Z, and a direct component, the relationship between X and Y given Z. Often, X, Y, and/or Z are measured with error. Structural equation modeling is widely used in this scenario. However, sociological data commonly have a nested structure (students within schools, residents within local areas). Hierarchical linear models represent such multilevel data well and can handle errors of measurement, but have not incorporated simultaneous equations for direct and indirect effects. This article incorporates the study of such mediated effects into the hierarchical linear model, naturally extending the analysis to include unbalanced, multilevel designs and missing data. The authors illustrate the approach by examining the extent to which neighborhood social control mediates the relationship between neighborhood social composition and violence in Chicago.},

In this article, the main contributions in terms of meaning, assumptions, and effects underlying a multilevel centering solution are reviewed, emphasizing advantages and critiques of this approach. In addition, in the spirit of Manski, contextual and correlated effects in a multilevel framework are defined to detect group effects. It is shown that the decision of centering in a multilevel analysis depends on the way the variables are centered, on whether the model has been specified with or without cross-level terms and group means, and on the purposes of the specific analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Classical factor analysis assumes a random sample of vectors of observations. For clustered vectors of observations, such as data for students from colleges, or individuals within households, it may be necessary to consider different within-group and between-group factor structures. Such a two-level model for factor analysis is defined, and formulas for a scoring algorithm for estimation with this model are derived. A simple noniterative method based on a decomposition of the total sums of squares and crossproducts is discussed. This method provides a suitable starting solution for the iterative algorithm, but it is also a very good approximation to the maximum likelihood solution. Extensions for higher levels of nesting are indicated. With judicious application of quasi-Newton methods, the amount of computation involved in the scoring algorithm is moderate even for complex problems; in particular, no inversion of matrices with large dimensions is involved. The methods are illustrated on two examples.},

This crude dichotomy does not allow for more differentiated judgments about the stage of consolidation of newly democratized political systems. To overcome this shortcoming, a multi-level model of democratic consolidation is proposed, consisting of four interdependent levels. The particular configuration of each has specific impact on the consolidation of the other levels. The four levels are: constitutional, representative, behavioural, and civic cultural consolidation. This model helps us to understand why new democracies survive or collapse, to identify the degree to which they are consolidated and the levels on which they are most vulnerable to internal and external shocks. It helps us to locate the parts of the political system where reforms should be implemented, or stopped or reversed in order to consolidate and stabilize a new democratic regime.},

Multi-level models are used to allow for national variation in the effects of education, including interactions with economic development and Communist rule. Education influences most political opinions; the effects can be summarized by saying that it promotes individualist values. Education is associated with somewhat lower confidence in most institutions. The relationship between education and confidence becomes weaker with economic development, while the effects of education on a number of political views shift to the left with economic development. The results suggest that education deserves more attention in explanations of national differences and historical trends in opinion.},

Over the last two decades, however, many countries have rid themselves of authoritarian regimes. There are many variations among these countries. Some of them have reverted to new brands of authoritarianism (even if from time to time they hold elections), while others have clearly embraced democracy. Still others seem to inhabit a gray area; they bear a family resemblance to the old established democracies, but either lack or only precariously possess some of their key attributes. The bulk of the contemporary scholarly literature tells us that these "incomplete" democracies are failing to become consolidated, or institutionalized. This poses two tasks. One is to establish a cutoff point that separates all democracies from all nondemocracies. This point's location depends on the questions we ask, and so is always arbitrary. Many definitions of democracy have been offered. The one that I find particularly useful is Robert Dahl's concept of "polyarchy." Once a reasonably well-delimited set of democracies is obtained, the second task is to examine the criteria that a given stream of the literature uses for comparing cases within this set.

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of intra-generational mobility patterns on collective social action. We start with the assumption that employees tend to collective action in pursuing their economic interests only if their social position is homogeneous, stable in time and characterized by privileges (or structural disadvantages). We believe that patterns of intra-generational mobility (and not only those of inter-generational mobility) are crucial for these preconditions of collective action. These conditions can come into effect only in systems of 'closed positions', where intra-generational mobility is restricted. In systems of open positions, a high degree of intra-generational mobility prevents the existence of homogeneous, stable and privileged social positions.In addition, the institutional arrangements of a given society, especially the educational system, determine to a great extent whether occupational positions are closed or not. In societies with standardized, stratified and differentiated educational systems, intra-generational mobility is restricted by credentialist allocation regimes so that the three conditions are fulfilled and patterns of collective action have a high probability of arising.This hypothesis is tested by an international comparison of effects on perceived social inequality using data from the International Social Justice Project (1991, 1996). It turns out that, as expected, in credentialist countries, educational titles and class position have stronger effects on perceived social inequality than in non-credentialist societies. But it was found that the economic system also plays an important role in the structuring of perceived inequality.},

income inequality influence the redistributive policy chosen in a society. But the
composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the
interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria
or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines
income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low
redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck
will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social
beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections,
and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting
allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help
explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and
choices of redistributivep olicies. (JEL D31, E62, H2, P16)},

Surprisingly we find that beliefs about overall inequality, measured in terms of income dispersion, play only a marginal role in political positions as well as prospects of future wealth. Political preferences, however, are predicted by first, beliefs about the level of income of the poorest members of society, and second, a belief in an open society with equal opportunities for all. Support for redistribution is lower for people who give higher estimates of the income level of the poorest members of society and for people who perceive that opportunities for upward mobility are available.},

Eastern Germany constitutes a case approaching a `natural experiment' for the social sciences, being twice the receiver of externally imposed institutions. It, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to closely analyse institutional effects on attitudes, as in this particular case, the time order of institutional and attitudinal changes can actually be decided. Using data from the International Social Survey Program modules on `The Role of Government' (1990, 1996, and 2006), attitudes towards government responsibilities are compared in Eastern and Western Germany, and to other countries. Results show a considerable convergence in attitudes between Eastern and Western Germany \textendash{} attitudes in Western Germany are completely stable while attitudes in Eastern Germany become, overtime, more similar to those found in the West. Furthermore, comparisons of different birth cohorts show that while considerable attitude differences between Eastern and Western Germany are still found in 2006 among those who had their forming experiences before the fall of the wall, differences are virtually nil among those who were still children in 1989. In summary, the analysis provides strong support for the attitude-forming effects of institutions, and a clear vindication of institutional theories. It also points to generational replacement as a key mechanism in translating institutional change into attitudinal change.},

Yet research on policy feedback is mostly anecdotal, and there has so far been little attempt to develop more general hypotheses about the conditions under which policies produce politics. Drawing on recent research, this article suggests that feedback occurs through two main mechanisms. Policies generate resources and incentives for political actors, and they provide those actors with information and cues that encourage particular interpretations of the political world. These mechanisms operate in a variety of ways, but have significant effects on government elites, interest groups, and mass publics. By investigating how policies influence different actors through these distinctive mechanisms, the article outlines a research agenda for moving from the current focus on illustrative case studies to the investigation of broader propositions about how and when policies are likely to be politically consequential.},

It shows that existing policies feed back into the political system, shaping subsequent policy outcomes. Policies exert this effect by altering not only the capacities, interests, and beliefs of political elites and states but also those of the public. Public policies can shape political participation and attitudes. These effects can be positive or negative, enhancing or undercutting participation and conferring positive or negative messages about individuals' worth as citizens. These effects originate in elements of program design, such as the size, visibility, and traceability of benefits, the proximity of beneficiaries, and modes of program administration. Thus, public policy itself shapes the distance of citizens from government, with profound implications for democratic governance.},

Differences in welfare state costs and benefits for these labor market groups are likely to fuel diverging incentives regarding welfare consumption. The article tests whether or not informal workers are driven mainly by economic self-interest to increase gains from public welfare goods. The study employed a hierarchical model on pooled survey data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) 2008 and 2010 to analyze the risk exposure of formal and informal workers and, subsequently, their preferences on redistribution. The analysis reveals that while economic self-interest is an influential factor for formal workers, it is (unexpectedly) much less so for informal workers. Also, an increased economically insecure environment, reflected by high unemployment rates, does not motivate informal workers to an exceptional degree to turn towards the state for redistribution, despite greater exposure to economic risk. Labor market dualization does not translate into polarization at the individual level regarding redistributive preferences in Latin America and the Caribbean.},

In this article we test the theory that different kinds of citizenship norms motivate some citizens to specialize in electoral-oriented activities (e.g. voting), while others specialize in non-institutionalized activities (e.g. protest). The latent class analysis of data from the U.S. Citizen, Involvement and Democracy Survey (2005) in the current study assesses how actors combine a variety of acts in their ``political tool kits'' of participation, and facilitates a comparison to prior findings that analyze single political behaviors. Results indicate a participatory type that specializes in non-institutionalized acts, but the group's high probability of voting does not align with the expectations in the literature. An electoral-oriented specialist type is not identified; instead, the findings show that a majority of the population is best characterized as disengaged, while a small group of all-around activists embrace all possible opportunities for political action. The actor-centered theoretical and measurement approach in this study identifies caveats to the theory that changing citizenship norms are leading to civic and political renewal. We discuss the implications of these findings for measuring different aspects of democratic (dis)engagement and participatory (in)equality.},

Using data from the 2008 European Social Survey, we show how this picture of human motivations provides a fertile framework to interpret support for redistribution among the general public. We test this claim through two ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. The evidence clearly shows that variables associated with `reciprocity' are better predictors of support for the redistributive role of the State than those associated with `self-interest', including the traditional socioeconomic variables, although both types of variables offer useful insights into the question of why people give support for redistribution.},

The issue of centering has been discussed in the literature, but it is still widely misunderstood. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed overview of grand mean centering and group mean centering in the context of 2-level MLMs. The authors begin with a basic overview of centering and explore the differences between grand and group mean centering in the context of some prototypical research questions. Empirical analyses of artificial data sets are used to illustrate key points throughout. The article provides a number of practical recommendations designed to facilitate centering decisions in MLM applications.},

  abstract = {A volume in Quantitative Methods in Education and the Behavioral Sciences: Issues, Research, and Teaching Series Editor Ron Serlin, University of Wisconsin (sponsored by the Educational Statisticians, SIG) Multilevel Modeling of Educational Data, co-edited by Ann A. O'Connell, Ed.D., and D. Betsy McCoach, Ph.D., is the next volume in the series: Quantitative Methods in Education and the Behavioral Sciences: Issues, Research and Teaching (Information Age Publishing), sponsored by the Educational Statisticians' Special Interest Group (Ed-Stat SIG) of the American Educational Research Association. The use of multilevel analyses to examine effects of groups or contexts on individual outcomes has burgeoned over the past few decades. Multilevel modeling techniques allow educational researchers to more appropriately model data that occur within multiple hierarchies (i.e.- the classroom, the school, and/or the district). Examples of multilevel research problems involving schools include establishing trajectories of academic achievement for children within diverse classrooms or schools or studying school-level characteristics on the incidence of bullying. Multilevel models provide an improvement over traditional single-level approaches to working with clustered or hierarchical data; however, multilevel data present complex and interesting methodological challenges for the applied education research community. In keeping with the pedagogical focus for this book series, the papers this volume emphasize applications of multilevel models using educational data, with chapter topics ranging from basic to advanced. This book represents a comprehensive and instructional resource text on multilevel modeling for quantitative researchers who plan to use multilevel techniques in their work, as well as for professors and students of quantitative methods courses focusing on multilevel analysis. Through the contributions of experienced researchers and teachers of multilevel modeling, this volume provides an accessible and practical treatment of methods appropriate for use in a first and/or second course in multilevel analysis. A supporting website links chapter examples to actual data, creating an opportunity for readers to reinforce their knowledge through hands-on data analysis. This book serves as a guide for designing multilevel studies and applying multilevel modeling techniques in educational and behavioral research, thus contributing to a better understanding of and solution for the challenges posed by multilevel systems and data.},

  abstract = {The gap between the richest and poorest Americans has grown steadily over the last thirty years, and economic inequality is on the rise in many other industrialized democracies as well. But the magnitude and pace of the increase differs dramatically across nations. A country's political system and its institutions play a critical role in determining levels of inequality in a society. Democracy, Inequality, and Representation argues that the reverse is also true\textemdash{}inequality itself shapes political systems and institutions in powerful and often overlooked ways.In Democracy, Inequality, and Representation, distinguished political scientists and economists use a set of international databases to examine the political causes and consequences of income inequality. The volume opens with an examination of how differing systems of political representation contribute to cross-national variations in levels of inequality. Torben Iverson and David Soskice calculate that taxes and income transfers help reduce the poverty rate in Sweden by over 80 percent, while the comparable figure for the United States is only 13 percent. Noting that traditional economic models fail to account for this striking discrepancy, the authors show how variations in electoral systems lead to very different outcomes.But political causes of disparity are only one part of the equation. The contributors also examine how inequality shapes the democratic process. Pablo Beramendi and Christopher Anderson show how disparity mutes political voices: at the individual level, citizens with the lowest incomes are the least likely to vote, while high levels of inequality in a society result in diminished electoral participation overall. Thomas Cusack, Iverson, and Philipp Rehm demonstrate that uncertainty in the economy changes voters' attitudes; the mere risk of losing one's job generates increased popular demand for income support policies almost as much as actual unemployment does. Ronald Rogowski and Duncan McRae illustrate how changes in levels of inequality can drive reforms in political institutions themselves. Increased demand for female labor participation during World War II led to greater equality between men and women, which in turn encouraged many European countries to extend voting rights to women for the first time.The contributors to this important new volume skillfully disentangle a series of complex relationships between economics and politics to show how inequality both shapes and is shaped by policy. Democracy, Inequality, and Representation provides deeply nuanced insight into why some democracies are able to curtail inequality\textemdash{}while others continue to witness a division that grows ever deeper.},

  abstract = {The social cohesion literature repeatedly criticizes a lack of consensus regarding the theoretical conceptualization of the construct. The current paper attempts to clarify this ambiguity by providing a literature review on the recent approaches. By taking a bird's eye view on previous conceptualizations of social cohesion we emphasize that in the majority of approaches there is in fact more overlap in the concept than has so far been assumed. In particular, we suggest three essential dimensions of social cohesion: (1) social relations, (2) identification with the geographical unit, and (3) orientation towards the common good. Each dimension is further differentiated into several sub-dimensions. We argue that additional elements identified in the literature (shared values, inequality, quality of life) are rather determinants or consequences of social cohesion, but not constituting elements. Suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Does public support for this economic model rise if the economy prospers, and fall during a downturn? Or is public support largely independent of the ups and downs of economic cycles? We hypothesize that positive economic performance increases support and that persons profiting personally are more supportive of the economic system's constitutive institutional elements. Using multilevel regression we study the determinants of individual-level support for the economic system. We also test for differences in the perception of economic performance due to political attitudes and personal properties. The findings partly support the hypotheses, indicating that macro-economic factors matter for individual-level attitudes towards the economy. Attitudes towards different institutional elements of the economic system also differ in the degree to which they are political or economic, and influenced by economic performance. Individual features \textendash{} education and personal economic stakes \textendash{} affect attitudes towards the economy, but a substantial share of the individual-level variation in economic attitudes remains unexplained.},

  abstract = {Corruption has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies, but it is widespread throughout the world. There is a question, however, as to whether corruption is endorsed as an outcome of a legitimate hierarchy and meritocracy. To address this issue, the present study examines the associations between meritocratic ideology and the indicators of corruption by performing two empirical studies with correlational and experimental designs. In Study 1, all variables were measured with scales, and the results demonstrated that meritocratic ideologies were negatively associated with corruption perception but positively associated with corrupt intention. In Study 2, meritocratic ideology was manipulated, and the results demonstrated that compared with the low meritocratic-ideology condition, the participants primed by the high meritocratic-ideology condition reported a lower corruption perception but higher corrupt intention. In both studies, the findings suggest that the meritocratic ideology that motivates people to maintain and bolster the current hierarchical structure and meritocracy leads to the endorsement of corruption. The present study explores the roles of meritocratic ideology in the perception and intention of corruption, extends the scope of the predictive power of system justification theory to corruption beyond mere injustice-related aspects of disadvantage, and also provides suggestions for interpreting and fighting against corruption.},

The described hypotheses are tested by using multinomial and multilevel logistic regressions and two complementary datasets\textemdash{}European Values Studies and the Life in Transition Survey.

Extant research has argued that this heuristic is learned from a variety of cultural, institutional, and ideological sources. The present article provides evidence supporting a different view: that the deservingness heuristic is rooted in psychological categories that evolved over the course of human evolution to regulate small-scale exchanges of help. To test predictions made on the basis of this view, a method designed to measure social categorization is embedded in nationally representative surveys conducted in different countries. Across the national- and individual-level differences that extant research has used to explain the heuristic, people categorize welfare recipients on the basis of whether they are lazy or unlucky. This mode of categorization furthermore induces people to think about large-scale welfare politics as its presumed ancestral equivalent: small-scale help giving.

Sociologists have long collected data on individual perceptions of where occupations stand relative to one another, but these data are rarely used to study the logics that individuals employ when categorizing occupations. Using the 1989 GSS occupational prestige module, we investigate how cognitive maps of the occupational hierarchy vary in terms of content and structure. The results show that maps are more homogeneous among individuals with more versus less education. This increased consensus arises, in part, because better educated respondents are more likely to set aside training-intensive occupations as a relatively elite set of occupations at the top of the hierarchy. In contrast, less educated respondents generate more gradational classification systems that are significantly less sensitive to training intensiveness as a basis for categorical distinction. This study contributes to our empirical knowledge of valuation and raises new questions about how individuals organize and navigate social structures.},

Over 300 teenagers completed a questionnaire which probed their perceptions of the attributions and consequences of poverty and wealth, and requested them to estimate the income for both a specified ``poor'' and ``rich'' man. The results indicate that all groups in this sample emphasized the significance of the family and downplayed the significance of luck when dealing with poverty and wealth. Further, the groups emphasized the economic consequences of poverty and wealth and they did not rate their psychological consequences as being of much importance. The results are discussed in terms of the small literature relevant to this topic.},

We advance conditional effects hypotheses that collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal counties, we find no significant differences between high- and low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality for American democracy.},

It focuses both on informal solidarity, such as volunteering, charitable giving, and informal care, and on formal solidarity, such as social benefits and development aid. It challenges the common belief that social solidarity is endangered by the increasing competition and capital flows between countries and by growing selfishness of modern citizens. The book scrutinizes the theoretical arguments that both informal solidarity and social solidarity organized through the welfare state are eroding. Empirically, it is the first thorough study of international comparative data on solidarity, globalization and individualization. The book concludes that, overall, solidarity is rising rather than declining. The impact of globalization and individualization is much more ambiguous than is often contended. While particular aspects of globalization and individualization might harm solidarity, other elements foster solidarity instead."--Publisher's description},

  volume = {96},
  issn = {1540-6237},
  abstract = {Objective

This article explores how income inequality and social mobility affect attitudes about redistribution in global perspective.

Methods

Individual-level data on over 50,000 individuals from 38 countries in the International Social Survey Programme are combined with country-level data from the World Bank, Standardized Income Inequality Database, and the Economic Freedom of the World data. OLS regression models with robust, clustered standard errors are estimated to account for the presence of unobserved, country-level effects in the error terms.

Results

Social mobility is found to be a more important predictor of preferences for redistribution than income inequality. Specifically, those who live in countries with greater social mobility are more supportive of redistribution while individuals who have experienced upward mobility themselves are less supportive, although an upwardly mobile individual in a more mobile society is more supportive of redistribution than an upwardly mobile individual in a less mobile society.

Conclusions

The central finding of this study is that the tangibility of redistributive social policies may bolster support for social spending. The structures and institutions that facilitate upward mobility\textemdash{}and potentially attenuate some of the detrimental effects of income inequality\textemdash{}are generally the products of more comprehensive redistribution policies, and public opinion may reflect this.},

This article investigates the extent to which people link policy preferences with unequal outcomes. As the American public is both aware and supportive of reducing income inequality in the abstract, it is an open question whether this concern is translated into support for policies that might help alleviate the rise in economic inequality.

Methods

Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is used with data from the General Social Survey (GSS).

Results

The relationship between attitudes about wealth inequality and spending preferences is positive, but not strong. Moreover, there is no evidence that the least well-off are more attuned to linking attitudes about inequality with spending preferences than the upper or middle classes.

Conclusion

The main findings suggest that while citizens are able to link attitudes about inequality with spending preferences, the link might not be strong enough to propel elected officials to act as wealth inequality expands.},

  abstract = {This paper draws on a literature in sociology, psychology and economics that has extensively documented the unfulfilled promise of meritocracy in education. I argue that the lesson learned from this literature is threefold: (1) educational institutions in practice significantly distort the ideal meritocratic process; (2) opportunities for merit are themselves determined by non-meritocratic factors; (3) any definition of merit must favor some groups in society while putting others at a disadvantage. Taken together, these conclusions give reason to understand meritocracy not just as an unfulfilled promise, but as an unfulfillable promise. Having problematized meritocracy as an ideal worth striving for, I argue that the pervasiveness of meritocratic policies in education threatens to crowd out as principles of justice, need and equality. As such, it may pose a barrier rather than a route to equality of opportunity. Furthermore, meritocratic discourse legitimates societal inequalities as justly deserved such as when misfortune is understood as personal failure. The paper concludes by setting a research agenda that asks how citizens come to hold meritocratic beliefs; addresses the persistence of (unintended) meritocratic imperfections in schools; analyzes the construction of a legitimizing discourse in educational policy; and investigates how education selects and labels winners and losers.},

Legitimation of social inequality occurs through individual-level, group-level, and system-level processes. In societies in which egalitarianism and fairness are core cultural values, legitimation permits differential treatment of people on the basis of their social group memberships while allowing people to maintain positive self-images, to reinforce group-based hierarchies and to justify a status quo that systematically benefits some individuals and groups more than others. In this article, we focus on three major theoretical perspectives in social psychology that have inspired most of the research featured in this special issue, and we offer a general overview of the articles to follow, expanding upon their connections to one another and to the theme of the issue. We highlight the promise of research on legitimation of social inequality not only for developing a deeper and more integrative theoretical understanding of intergroup relations but also for guiding interventions to achieve social equality in practice.

The most common way across paradigmatic camps is to spot various `gaps' in the literature and, based on that, to formulate specific research questions. The dominance of gap-spotting is surprising, given it is increasingly recognized that theory is made interesting and influential when it challenges assumptions that underlie existing literature. The article discusses why assumption-challenging approaches are rare, and it identifies a range of social norms that favour gap-spotting. Finally, the article proposes some ways of constructing research questions that move beyond gap-spotting, and discusses how these ways are likely to promote more interesting and significant theories.},

They also provided ratings of this group on traits related to warmth and competence. Study 2 employed both trait ratings and implicit measures (Single Category-IATs) in order to estimate the strength of the associations between the poor and warmth/competence, respectively.

The other, based on self-interest, combines an ``insurance'' model of preferences for redistribution with increasingly segmented labor markets, in which immigration of workers without recognized skills leaves most native workers better off but intensifies competition for low-end jobs. Empirically, when we estimate parameters from the two models using data from multiple waves of ISSP surveys, we find that labor market segmentation, previously omitted in this literature, has more consistent effects than social distance.},

Thompson's approach reflects only a minor part of this conceptual history. His understanding of moral economy is conditioned by a dichotomous view of history and by the acceptance of a model according to which modern economy is not subject to moral concerns. It is on principle problematic to confine a term conjoining two concepts as general as `moral' and `economy' to a specific historical and social setting. Recent approaches that frame moral economy as an emotively defined order of morals are also misleading since they do not address economic issues in the way they are commonly understood. The most promising current approaches appear to be those that consider the moral economy of welfare, humanitarianism, and civil society. The concept of moral economy may help us to clarify alternative ways of `utility maximisation' through the construction of altruistic meaning for economic transactions.},

The authors hypothesize that the wage-bargaining practices of unions promote egalitarian distributive norms, which lead union members to support redistribution, and that this effect is strongest among high-wage workers. Consistent with the authors' expectations, the empirical analysis shows that the solidarity effect of union membership is strongest when unions encompass a very large share of the labor force or primarily organize low-wage workers. The authors also show that low-wage workers have become a significantly less important union constituency in many European countries over the time period covered by the analysis.},

Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study's own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three distinctly different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.},

  abstract = {Context effects, where a characteristic of an upper-level unit or cluster (e.g., a country) affects outcomes and relationships at a lower level (e.g., that of the individual), are a primary object of sociological inquiry. In recent years, sociologists have increasingly analyzed such effects using quantitative multilevel modeling. Our review of multilevel studies in leading sociology journals shows that most assume the effects of lower-level control variables to be invariant across clusters, an assumption that is often implausible. Comparing mixed-effects (random-intercept and slope) models, cluster-robust pooled OLS, and two-step approaches, we find that erroneously assuming invariant coefficients reduces the precision of estimated context effects. Semi-formal reasoning and Monte Carlo simulations indicate that loss of precision is largest when there is pronounced cross-cluster heterogeneity in the magnitude of coefficients, when there are marked compositional differences among clusters, and when the number of clusters is small. Although these findings suggest that practitioners should fit more flexible models, illustrative analyses of European Social Survey data indicate that maximally flexible mixed-effects models do not perform well in real-life settings. We discuss the need to balance parsimony and flexibility, and we demonstrate the encouraging performance of one prominent approach for reducing model complexity.},

Three studies tested whether perceived social mobility\textemdash{}beliefs about the likelihood to move up and down the socioeconomic ladder\textemdash{}can condition people's tendency to engage in system justification. Compared to information suggesting moderate social mobility, exposure to low social mobility frames consistently reduced defense of the overarching societal system. Two studies examined how this effect occurs. Compared to moderate or baseline conditions, a low social mobility frame reduced people's endorsement of (typically strong) meritocratic and just-world beliefs, which in turn explained lower system defense. These effects occurred for political liberals, moderates, and conservatives and could not be explained by other system-legitimizing ideologies or people's beliefs about their own social mobility. Implications for societal change programs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been on the rise in the United States since the 1980s and by some measures stands at levels not seen since before the Great Depression. Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans' relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective\textemdash{}the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1, n = 480; and study 2, n = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3, n = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

  abstract = {In this paper, trend descriptions of social inequality perceptions and justice beliefs in six transformation societies of Eastern and Central Europe are reported. Based on data of the International Social Justice Project (ISJP), developments from 1991 to 1996 in Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia, the Czech Republic, and East Germany are documented and compared to results of the Western countries that participated in the project. It is first shown that in most of the transformation societies social inequality is believed to have increased over the 5-year interval, in particular, due to increase in number of poverty-stricken individuals, and that external ``system forces'' are made responsible for this development. Has this affected the level of acceptance of the free-market economy as a just-distribution order? In terms of favoring particular distribution rules\textemdash{}equal opportunities, need, individual effort, and merit\textemdash{}the answer is negative because the relative strength of endorsement of these rules has not changed from 1991 to 1996, but there are clear indications that the respondents in the transformation countries tend to see life chances and economic success increasingly determined by factors over which the individual has no control. At the same time, political legitimization in terms of trust in institutions has decayed, whereas, paradoxically, the call for state interventions has become more pronounced. But the demand for the state to intervene and for nonmeritocratic distribution principles is clearly status-dependent and is thus structured similar to what we find in the Western nontransformation societies.},

Weber's (1958) model of class, status, and power, and 6 indicators (income, occupation, education, influence on others, ethnic origin, lifestyle) corresponding to Weber's model. 118 Israeli blue collar employees indicated whether they perceived a class-based stratified structure and rated themselves on a standard class scale. Ss also assessed the correspondence between their CI and the 6 items. The 6 indicators explained about 20\% of CI, and 3 were found to be stable: income, influence on others, and lifestyle. It is concluded that the meaning attached by Ss to CI approximated an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

The objective position of individuals, the wealth of nations, and the national level of unemployment all have substantial effects on subjective status.

After respondents in a national survey had been asked with which of these five classes they identified, they were asked how they would assign various occupations to the classes and whatcriteria they used to define membership in their own class. Most respondents were able to assign a variety of occupations to social classes with little or no hesitation, and there was high agreement about the class location of occupations. The prevailing class assignments of those occupations reflect hierarchical socioeconomic characteristics (such as income, job authority, education, and skill) rather than a qualitative blue-collar/white-collar distinction. Finally, the criteria thatrespondents selected as important in defining the social class with which they identify suggest that class is at least as much a social as an economic phenomenon in the United States.},

Three thousand nine hundred fifteen articles were reviewed, yielding 710 articles using social class.

Class interest theory predicts that the higher a person's objective position and subjective class identification, the more likely s/he is to hold a conservative ideology concerning class issues (e.g., do large firms have too much power? Should employees protest against their employer's personnel practices, and go on strike?). Multiple regression analysis provides only partial confirmation for class interest theory. The finding that the most educated and those in professional and technical occupations are the least conservative on class issues is interpreted as supporting a "new class" form of class interest theory. While the Taiwan respondents are not generally conservative on these class issues, their class identification appears to have little to do with whether they are conservative or nonconservative, either before or after objective position in the stratification system is held constant.

A 10 rung self-anchoring scale was used to measure subjective social status in the Whitehall II study, a prospective cohort study of London-based civil service employees. Results indicate that subjective status is a strong predictor of ill-health, and that education, occupation and income do not explain this relationship fully for all the health measures examined. The results provide further support for the multidimensional nature of both social inequality and health. Multiple regression shows subjective status to be determined by occupational position, education, household income, satisfaction with standard of living, and feeling of financial security regarding the future. The results suggest that subjective social status reflects the cognitive averaging of standard markers of socioeconomic situation and is free of psychological biases.},

The research reported here questions the generality of that conceptualization by examining the relative importance of manual-nonmanual class differences and prestige differences for several attitudes and behaviors. First, the perception of "working class" and "middle class" more closely reflects a manual-nonmanual dichotomy than a continuous prestige scale. Voting behavior and party identification are also better predicted by the dichotomy. Second, the relevance of bounded class and continuous status models varies according to the issues involved. Thus, some interpersonal behaviors and individual satisfactions are patterned according to continuous prestige rankings while opinions on societal issues reflect dichotomous class differences. Third, individuals vary in their propensity to use class or status models according to social structural influences. For instance, a prestige orientation is fostered by small, traditional industries while the class dichotomy is more important in large, bureaucratic industries. The evidence also indicates that occupational prestige is more a middle-class concern, with little importance for manual workers.},

Some support was found for the contention that individuals engage in self-enhancing attributions under conditions of success, but only minimal evidence suggested that individuals engage in self-protective attributions under conditions of failure. Moreover, it was proposed that the self-enhancing effect may not be due to motivational distortion, but rather to the tendency of people to (a) expect their behavior to produce success, (b) discern a closer covariation between behavior and outcomes in the case of increasing success than in the case of constant failure, and (c) misconstrue the meaning of contingency.

  abstract = {People's self-perception biases often lead them to see themselves as better than the average person (a phenomenon known as self-enhancement). This bias varies across cultures, and variations are typically explained using cultural variables, such as individualism versus collectivism. We propose that socioeconomic differences among societies\textemdash{}specifically, relative levels of economic inequality\textemdash{}play an important but unrecognized role in how people evaluate themselves. Evidence for self-enhancement was found in 15 diverse nations, but the magnitude of the bias varied. Greater self-enhancement was found in societies with more income inequality, and income inequality predicted cross-cultural differences in self-enhancement better than did individualism/collectivism. These results indicate that macrosocial differences in the distribution of economic goods are linked to microsocial processes of perceiving the self.},

Statistical analysis showed the existence of three components which initially grouped the various causal attributions for poverty in developing countries: ``Fault of the world economic structure'', ``Fault of fate, nature, cultural habits, and political misconduct'' and ``Fault of the developing countries' population''. Five types of subjects were subsequently identified according to the type of causal attributions of poverty that the undergraduates had made and their country of origin, perceived social class, economic situation, political ideology and religious beliefs. The results obtained show that the causal attributions of poverty in developing countries are mainly influenced by the level of development in the country of origin of interviewees, their political ideology and their economic situation.},

The present article seeks to contribute to this field by examining the issue of youth citizenship from a comparative international perspective and proposing a simplified conceptual model that can be operationalized. This model includes a community dimension, which refers to individual's relationship with their community associations, and a civic dimension, concerning institutional processes such as voting and/or political activism. The model was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and measurement equivalence for eighth-grade students (n = 139.875) across 38 countries that participated in the International Civic and Citizenship Study (2009). Our results find support for the proposed conceptual model and its invariance across countries, and we discuss the implications for theory and further research.},

  abstract = {Attribution theory posits that poverty beliefs vary along the causal properties of locus, stability, personal control, and other control. The current paper extends this framework by using a latent profile analysis to identify the unique response patterns (latent profiles) that underlie these beliefs. Results indicated that participants (N=315) displayed one of three attributional profiles: Blaming (high internal locus; moderate stability; high personal control; high other control), Caring (low internal locus; moderate stability; low personal control; high other control), or Ambivalent (moderate across causal properties). Subsequent analyses showed that levels of conservatism and system justification positively correlated with membership in the Blaming (vs. Caring) profile. In turn, belonging in the Blaming (vs. Caring) profile predicted more anger, less sympathy, and less support for the poor. These findings advance attribution theory by taking a person-centered perspective and demonstrating that three distinct response patterns underlie individual differences in people's poverty beliefs.},

Instead, these systems are structured by consumerism, exploitation and marginalization, breeding a social-Darwinian atmosphere within school environments that results in many students feeling socially worthless and as though they have under-achieved.},

  abstract = {Historic increases in income inequality have coincided with widening class divides in parental investments of money and time in children. These widening class gaps are significant because parental investment is one pathway by which advantage is transmitted across generations. Using over three decades of micro-data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the American Heritage Time Use Survey linked to state-year measures of income inequality, we test the relationship between income inequality and class gaps in parental investment. We find robust evidence of wider class gaps in parental financial investments in children\textemdash{}but not parental time investments in children\textemdash{}when state-level income inequality is higher. We explore mechanisms that may drive the relationship between rising income inequality and widening class gaps in parental financial investments in children. This relationship is partially explained by the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution in state-years with higher inequality, which gives higher-earning households more money to spend on financial investments in children. In addition, we find evidence for contextual effects of higher income inequality that reshape parental preferences toward financial investment in children differentially by class.},

  abstract = {Individuals with a higher social position are more tolerant of current income inequality than individuals with a lower social position. Besides this, attitudes towards income inequality are influenced by inequality-legitimising myths in a given society. Little is known about how these two factors interact. This study combines these two lines of research and argues that different social strata are more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies with strong prevalent meritocratic perceptions. We expect lower-status individuals (i.e. with a lower income or education) to experience a threat to their group esteem and therefore be less likely to support their society's inequalities in societies with such strong meritocratic perceptions. This hypothesis was tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2009 (Social Inequality) on 39 countries. The results show that different social strata are indeed more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies where meritocratic perceptions are more prevalent. Our results are robust for income, but not for education. This suggests that in perceived meritocracies, people regard income as the primary indicator of effort and ability.},

Chinese and Americans share a strong belief in the importance of education, ambition, and hard work for getting ahead. The Chinese, however, also believe strongly in nonmeritocratic elements, especially social ties. They are thus much more likely than Americans to have a dual-consciousness about getting ahead. Perceptions also vary within each country. In the United States, minorities perceive less meritocracy than whites and men perceive less meritocracy than women. These factors, however, do not explain variations in Chinese perceptions, which are more closely tied to China-specific predictors (e.g., hukou status). We also find that Chinese perceptions reflect the degree of contact with nonrelatives and people in occupations more prestigious than one's own. Together, these findings suggest that American beliefs about the role of merit in social mobility are not unique. They also highlight a need for studies of stratification beliefs in nondemocratic, non-Western countries and research that examines how life experiences influence stratification beliefs.},

  abstract = {Exceptional cases are at odds with the typical: they stand out as bizarre and rare. What then could justify their systematic analysis? Elaborating the analytical distinction between anomalies, exceptions and outliers, this paper outlines three potential epistemic contributions of exceptional cases. First, exceptional cases reveal the limits of standard classification categories. In so doing, they problematize usual classificatory grids. Their input is critical. Second, exceptional cases point to new classes of objects. They acquire paradigmatic status when they exemplify the characteristic features of these new classes with utmost clarity. Third, exceptional cases magnify relational patterns that in more mundane contexts lack visibility. Here their contribution is heuristic. These three contributions become possible when we put at bay normative expectations of what should happen, and specify cases by reference to an analytical space of constitutive dimensions. To underscore the general significance of these observations, I draw on examples borrowed from different quarters of the social sciences: the sociology of organizations, ethnomethodology, comparative historical sociology and the history of science., Les cas exceptionnels apparaissent le plus souvent comme atypiques, bizarres ou rares. D{\`e}s lors comment justifier d'en proposer une analyse syst{\'e}matique ? {\`A} partir d'une distinction analytique entre les anomalies, les exceptions et les d{\'e}viations, cet article met en avant trois contributions {\'e}pist{\'e}miques des cas exceptionnels. Tout d'abord, les cas exceptionnels r{\'e}v{\`e}lent les limites des cat{\'e}gories et classifications standards. Ils permettent de probl{\'e}matiser les grilles classificatoires. Leur apport est critique. Ensuite, les cas exceptionnels permettent d'identifier de nouvelles classes d'objets. Ils acqui{\`e}rent un statut paradigmatique lorsqu'ils manifestent les caract{\'e}ristiques sp{\'e}cifiques de ces nouvelles classes. Enfin, les cas exceptionnels mettent en {\'e}vidence des mod{\`e}les relationnels qui dans des contextes plus ordinaires resteraient invisibles. Leur contribution est ici heuristique.

We test these arguments using an online experiment that manipulated the level of inequality (high vs. low) in an anonymized society. Participants perceived a larger merit gap in high versus low inequality societies. Our arguments and findings have implications for attitudes about inequality and redistributive policies.},

Much less is known however about the sources of people's different beliefs. Meanwhile, a separate line of research has made great advances in understanding how people make inferences about the unobservable causes of (social) outcomes. In this paper, I bring the two lines of research together to show how inequality beliefs are problems of causal inference: people observe unequal outcomes and must infer the invisible forces that brought these about, be they meritocratic or structural in nature. I argue that a synthesis of cognition, psychology, and sociology allows for a view of lay causal inference as shaped by (1) general cognitive bias, (2) specific contextual factors, and (3) the durable impact of social environment. Specifically, I suggest that we study people's understanding of inequality as an inferential process based on biased and incomplete information, and shaped by the environments that constitute the social context in which they learn about the world. To the extent that these environments expose people only to a certain type and range of information about inequality, institutions like neighborhoods, schools and workplaces are inferential spaces that deeply shape the development of inequality beliefs.},

Broadly speaking, attitudes reflect regime differences, with distinctive emphasis on reciprocity and the value of work in Germany, inclusion and equality in Norway, and individual responsibility and the work-ethic in the UK. Neo-liberal market-centred ideas appear to have made little headway in regard to popular attitudes, except in the already liberal-leaning UK. There is also a striking assumption by UK participants that welfare is threatened externally by immigrants who take jobs from established workers and internally by the work-shy who undermine the work-ethic. A key role of the welfare state is repressive rather than enabling: to protect against threats to well-being rather than provide benefits for citizens. UK participants also anticipate major decline in state provision. In all three countries there is strong support for continuing and expanding social investment policies, but for different reasons: to enable contribution in Germany, to promote equality and mobility in Norway, and to facilitate self-responsibility in the UK.},

Even within countries, people across the political spectrum are said to be in remarkable agreement about the ideal level of economic inequality. Using survey data from 40 countries and a novel survey experiment in the United States, we show that this apparent agreement is illusory. When relying on a widely used cross-national survey measure of Ideal Pay Ratios, preferred levels of inequality are heavily influenced by two well-documented sources of perceptual distortion: the anchoring effect and ratio bias. These effects are substantial and many times larger than the influence of fundamental political predispositions. As a result, these cross-national survey measures tapping preferences regarding economic inequality produce misleading conclusions about desired levels of inequality.},

We suggest that these two phenomena can be reconciled by noticing that, despite appearances to the contrary, there is no evidence that people are bothered by economic inequality itself. Rather, they are bothered by something that is often confounded with inequality: economic unfairness. Drawing upon laboratory studies, cross-cultural research, and experiments with babies and young children, we argue that humans naturally favour fair distributions, not equal ones, and that when fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair inequality over unfair equality. Both psychological research and decisions by policymakers would benefit from more clearly distinguishing inequality from unfairness.},

Previous research suggests that children have an early ability to take merit into account in third-party situations but that merit-based sharing in first-party contexts does not emerge until school-age. Here we provide evidence that three- and five-year-old children already use merit to share resources with others, even when sharing is costly for the child. In Study 1, a child and a puppet-partner collected coins that were later exchanged for rewards. We varied the work-contribution of both partners by manipulating how many coins each partner collected. Children kept fewer stickers in trials in which they had contributed less than in trials in which they had contributed more than the partner, showing that they took merit into account. Few children, however, gave away more than half of the stickers when the partner had worked more. Study 2 confirmed that children related their own work-contribution to their partner's, rather than simply focusing on their own contribution. Taken together, these studies show that merit-based sharing is apparent in young children; however it remains constrained by a self-serving bias.},

Repeated surveys draw on a representative sample of the population to describe the typical beliefs held by citizens in a given country and period. Leveraging the fact that citizens surveyed in a given year were born in different time-periods allows for a comparison of beliefs across birth cohorts. The latter overlaps with the former, but considerably extends the time period covered by the data. Taken together, the two measures give a ``triangulated'' longitudinal record of popular belief in meritocracy. I find that in most countries, popular belief in meritocracy is (much) stronger for more recent periods and cohorts.},

  abstract = {While multiple-country repeated cross-sectional datasets are increasingly available, few cross-national studies fully exploit the richness of such data. This paper contributes to the practical knowledge on statistical analysis of cross-national time series data. For that purpose, we present a novel application of a societal growth curve model (Fairbrother, 2014) analyzing the pressing question whether the economic crisis of the past years has stirred up immigration-related threat perceptions among European citizens. Concretely, we analyze six rounds of European Social Survey data (2002-2012) to investigate whether indicators of economic downturn are systematically related to increased levels of economic and cultural threat. The societal growth curve modeling approach makes it possible to set longitudinal effects apart from cross-sectional differences and thus overcomes the weaknesses of analyses relying on single-shot cross-sectional data. Our results provide evidence that growing unemployment as well as decreasing rates of economic growth instigate feelings of economic threat. Rather than affecting citizens' opinion uniformly, the economic crisis is found to have the strongest impact on economic threat among low educated people. While this study provides evidence that economic shocks affect concerns that immigration is bad for the economy, feelings of cultural threat are not affected by economic crises.},

  abstract = {Technological change is widely considered to be a key driver of the economic and occupational structure of affluent countries. Current advances in information technology have led to a significant substitution of routine work by capital, while occupations with abstract or interpersonal manual task structures are complemented or unaffected. We develop a simple theoretical framework for the reasons why individuals in routine task-intensive occupations would prefer public insurance against the increased risk of future income loss resulting from automation. Moreover, we contend that this relation will be stronger for richer individuals who have more to lose from automation. We focus on the role of occupational elements of risk exposure and challenge some general interpretations of the determinants of redistribution preferences. We test the implications of our theoretical framework with survey data for 17 European countries between 2002 and 2012. While up to now the political economy literature has emphasized other occupational risks, we find vulnerability to automation to be an important determinant of the demand for redistribution that should not be ignored.},

Drawing on vast data sets and cutting-edge research, he explains the benign and malign forces that make inequality rise and fall within and among nations. He also reveals who has been helped the most by globalization, who has been held back, and what policies might tilt the balance toward economic justice. Global Inequality takes us back hundreds of years, and as far around the world as data allow, to show that inequality moves in cycles, fueled by war and disease, technological disruption, access to education, and redistribution. The recent surge of inequality in the West has been driven by the revolution in technology, just as the Industrial Revolution drove inequality 150 years ago. But even as inequality has soared within nations, it has fallen dramatically among nations, as middle-class incomes in China and India have drawn closer to the stagnating incomes of the middle classes in the developed world. A more open migration policy would reduce global inequality even further. Both American and Chinese inequality seem well entrenched and self-reproducing, though it is difficult to predict if current trends will be derailed by emerging plutocracy, populism, or war. For those who want to understand how we got where we are, where we may be heading, and what policies might help reverse that course, Milanovic's compelling explanation is the ideal place to start."--Provided by publisher},

Despite the constant references to meritocracy in inequality and stratification research, there are still few conceptual and empirical attempts to understand to what extent individuals perceive and prefer meritocracy, as well as their consequences. The present research proposes a conceptual and empirical framework for  studying meritocratic perceptions and preferences, which is then related with economic inequality variables. Using data from the Chilean survey ``Social justice and citizenship participation'', the analyses suggest that meritocratic perceptions and preferences are different constructs and that those perceiving an adequate functioning of meritocracy also perceive less economic inequality.},
